        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jupiter LFG Launchpad Beta!</p><p>Delighted to share our very beta LFG Launchpad, the first and only system whose goal is to infuse projects with love 💕 from a genuine Jupiter DAO and community, sets them up with long term success and protects their buyers from hype, fomo and rugs.</p><p>Unlike other launchpads, this launchpad will not have any complex <em>(and often fucked)</em> incentive mechanisms, or isolated price discovery systems - relying on the community, open market and ecosystem to do their things instead.</p><p>There will also be 2 tokens launching on LFG in Jupuary, of which we share more details below too. This is <strong>VERY BETA</strong>, so we expect to uncover a lot more issues over these 2 weeks, including the JUP launch.</p><p>It is risky, but hey, if we don't dogfood our own launchpad with our own JUP, how am I going to ask others to trust me with theirs right? So let's see if we can make this work😆</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="key-features">Key Features:<a href="#key-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Features:" title="Direct link to Key Features:">​</a></h2><ul><li>Largest community rooting for you, maybe even becoming users!</li><li>Millions of airdrop recipients can claim at once</li><li>Launch pool that's customizable for projects needs, locks team LP for days and mitigate bot advantage powered by the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/MeteoraAG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MeteoraAG</a> DLMM</li><li>Highly intuitive tool to design the liquidity pool exactly the way you want*</li><li>Special network reporting and gas management panel to handle on-chain chaos</li><li>Full trading features but focused on the pre-ordering process </li><li>Integration with full network of bots so you can choose your fav bot to use it with</li><li>Full enterprise level RPC, Cloudflare and FE support</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="LFG1" src="/assets/images/lfg1-5b2d64629677cf59cf6ea9fa236acf14.jpeg" width="1476" height="996" class="img_MG2L"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="key-goals">Key Goals:<a href="#key-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Goals:" title="Direct link to Key Goals:">​</a></h2><ul><li>LFG Price discovery: Everyone starts at once, no complicated isolated pool mechanisms.

Our best in class user support will extend to you too.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="references">References:<a href="#references" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to References:" title="Direct link to References:">​</a></h2><p>For more details on motivations and technical updates, you can refer to this draft jupresearch post.</p><p><a href="https://jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-lfg-launchpad-beta/31" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jupresear.ch/t/jupiter-lfg-launchpad-beta/31</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="custom-price-curve-modeling">Custom Price Curve Modeling<a href="#custom-price-curve-modeling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom Price Curve Modeling" title="Direct link to Custom Price Curve Modeling">​</a></h3><p>Unlike other liquidity curves the point here is NOT price discovery or equilibrium, but rather liquidity bootstrapping and backstopping. Along with every project's extremely different needs and context, a custom price curve tool is needed.</p><p>Enter The LFG Price Curve design, maths, paper and website is being developed by intern #2 <a href="https://twitter.com/Village_Idiot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Village_Idiot</a>, who is mid way through high school. </p><p><a href="https://lfg-design.jup.ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://lfg-design.jup.ag</a></p><p>This tool here to help project teams design the price curves they want, which will then automatically tell them the amount raised at different price points, executes the mathematical translation into DLMM bins etc.</p><p>The important here is that there is no need to determine or set an initial price - you can just decide your initial price (which is important for determining bot advantage), your final price (important depending on your liquidity needs) and how steep you want the price to increase.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="LFG4" src="/assets/images/lfg4-81d90313abc7dc0cb537b9db6537dbd6.jpeg" width="2116" height="1206" class="img_MG2L">
<em>Graph y-axis does not start from 0</em></p><p> For example, in this configuration you can see here the starting price is low to incentivize early liquidity, but the curve steeps strongly upwards with only a small number of tokens available for early takers before a more gentle slope occurs. This incentivizes early aggressive price action while leaving most tokens for users.</p><p>Alternatively, less hyped project can certainly opt for a more gentle slope with a higher starting price, which will allow everyone to acquire the tokens gradually over time without much price advantage for early buyers.</p><p>While the current tooling only supports on single curve, we will be adding a lot more curves over the coming year, including S-shaped and U-shaped ones.  We look forward to experimenting with various configurations over this year, and I am sure best practises will start to show up over time!</p><p>The full research paper and post will be up soon. He writes like a 5th grader, so be kind.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="first-2-projects-for-lfg-beta">First 2 Projects For LFG Beta:<a href="#first-2-projects-for-lfg-beta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to First 2 Projects For LFG Beta:" title="Direct link to First 2 Projects For LFG Beta:">​</a></h2><p>We are trying out a lot of new things with this launchpad, and many, many things can go wrong. As such, we will host a lower stakes launch first, and then finally eat our own dog food with JUP. </p><ol><li>A fun coin managed by our good friends <a href="https://twitter.com/OvolsNFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OvolsNFT</a> will launch this week some help from me.  I will have zero financial stake in it, and Jupiter will have zero involvement in the memecoin. </li></ol><p>With even more airdrop recipients than JUP, it will be a much lower stakes, fun, but similarly extremely technically challenging test for the launch pad.</p><ol start="2"><li>Following week, on 31st of Jupuary, we will of course launch JUP. Yes, we are dogfooding our own launchpad ourselves with JUP. </li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jupiter-dao">Jupiter DAO<a href="#jupiter-dao" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Jupiter DAO" title="Direct link to Jupiter DAO">​</a></h2><p>In both cases, both <a href="https://twitter.com/OvolsNFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OvolsNFT</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Jupiterexchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Jupiterexchange</a> will provide 1% to LFG launchpad, of which the upcoming JUP DAO will receive 75% and the team 25%. </p><p>So that should be a nice early bonus to the DAO. The team will keep this first, and transfer to the DAO after it forms.</p><p>Moving forward, the Jupiter DAO will approve new projects to be on the launchpad. It has to be throughly responsible for making sure the projects are worthy of being promoted to all Jupiter users, and then doing what they can to make the project as successful as possible.</p><p>There will be no bullshit like insider arrangements, secret profit sharing and token gating. The above arrangement is a pure, simple and mutually beneficial approach to token launches.</p><p>Given that the Jupiter DAO will be the largest, most non-insider voting, most dynamic and open minded DAO in the history of DAOs, we are confident </p><p>The team will provide all required support to projects approved by the DAO, with the likely maximum of one project every 2 weeks to maintain a very high quality pipeline.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="1st-feb-ready-for-projects">1st Feb: Ready For Projects<a href="#1st-feb-ready-for-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1st Feb: Ready For Projects" title="Direct link to 1st Feb: Ready For Projects">​</a></h2><p>We hope this gives a nice overview of our LFG launchpad, and our road towards launching Jupiter. We look forward to your active participation in these 2 launches. </p><p>If all goes well, we will be able to start offering the launchpad to projects who would like to launch with Jupiter!</p><p>Otherwise.... Well, at least we mess up together as a community right? 🩷</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last week, as everyone in the world was hunting me for JUP updates, I must confess to being very inspired by this video instead.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Juppiecats1" src="/assets/images/juppiecats1-d6aaa6cb1055eb6eb219ce605ee0456c.jpeg" width="1094" height="898" class="img_MG2L"></p><p>I mean, check this out - the level of care he takes to get the cat ready is exquisite. The cat is now well-fed, very clean, and at peace. And that’s a cat ready to tackle the incredibly messy world ahead with all kinds of possibilities and adversities. And that’s the amount of care we aspire to get Jupiter to as we ready for JUP.</p><p>As much as we would love to just launch JUP and get back to building world-class tech, we also want to make sure all the key things that are important to us - the token distribution, the ethos, making sure no one is left behind - are clearly decided, communicated, and clarified, because things are really quite different after the genesis moment.</p><p>Some of these are pretty controversial topics, but that’s the whole point of me highlighting them now. I hope to have these discussions as early as possible so we start JUP with as much common understanding and alignment as possible across every part of the stack. I will be on Discord and Reddit as much as possible over the next few days to debate, discuss and clarify anything.</p><p>Because, as I have said from day one, this is not just my journey, this is ours. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jup">JUP<a href="#jup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JUP" title="Direct link to JUP">​</a></h2><p>Since cats have small brains and did not go to MIT or Jane Street, we cannot process super complicated token plans and confusing power dynamics. </p><p>So instead, here’s a pie with cats:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Juppiecats2" src="/assets/images/juppiecats2-98851a0f70517060b888ce04a80ed9a2.jpeg" width="1016" height="962" class="img_MG2L"></p><p>Tokenomics reflect the ethos of a project, and our key ethos is as simple as it gets - For a project like Jupiter, there needs to be an equal weight between a focused entity able to constantly recruit world-class talent, build product, and execute strategy, and a wider community able to fact-check, counterweight, and help to course-correct.</p><p>As such, the 10B JUP will be 50% managed by the team, 50% distributed to the community. Perfectly balanced, as all cats should be.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Juppiecats3" src="/assets/images/juppiecats3-fb154c43dc17945344aa5995cd1b3d40.png" width="896" height="350" class="img_MG2L"></p><p>We believe this balance will be extremely important to the long-term success of Jupiter. The community needs to trust the team and give room for maneuver, while the team needs to trust the community and invite everyone to be genuine stakeholders. Without this understanding, it will just be endless angst on both sides, the root cause of the classic “devs do something” phenomenon.</p><p>The major change from the green paper is that there is no more token sale. Instead, the 20% will now be divided between 10% for liquidity provision, and 10% for community contributors and grants.</p><p>For the team managed component, only the 10% of liquidity provision will be used in the first year. The 20% for the current team will start vesting after a year for 2 years. The remaining 20% will be the strategic reserve, used for future team members, future strategic investors, and for past Mercurial stakeholders. </p><p>The last component will be locked for at least a year, with a minimum of six months' notice given to the community before any liquidity event can happen. Each of these pools will be held in separate muti-sigs for easy trackability by the public.</p><p>For the community component, we expect 40% to be broken up over 4 rounds of “growing the pie” airdrops. We are very excited about the availability of 10% for community contributors and grants - this allocation, likely given to the DAO to administer, should give a lot of incentive for the community to participate in initiatives to grow Jupiter, vet projects for the Solana ecosystem, and drive the decentralized meta - all of which are our main objectives.</p><p>I’ll share more thoughts and a proposed roadmap on how the DAO can incrementally grow in terms of scope, participants, responsibilities to become what I hope can become the most productive DAO in the history of crypto not just for Jupiter but for advancing the whole crypto ecosystem forward. </p><p>It will take time, years, but based on what I’m seeing so far, I’m actually incredibly bullish our DAO can get there. Slowly and incrementally for sure, but we will. One reason why I’m so bullish on this is because of the unique, positive, expansive vibes of the Jupiter and Solana community. Will elaborate more next time.</p><p>Now that there is no more presale, the launch will be very simple. 15-20% will be circulating initially. 10% is from the first airdrop and 5% for liquidity provision, which will either be mostly or entirely on-chain. We are also leaving open the possibility of having up to 5% more liquidity be available at launch. Details for claiming and the mechanism for liquidity provision will be shared over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>We would like the launch to happen in Jan, and currently coordinating with a range of partners to make it happen.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="the-decentralized-meta">The Decentralized Meta<a href="#the-decentralized-meta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Decentralized Meta" title="Direct link to The Decentralized Meta">​</a></h2><p>At Jupiter, we want to be a leading force in driving the decentralized meta forward - aka a world where everyone not just buys crypto, but actually uses crypto in their daily life as well.</p><p>As the best trading venue in crypto <em>(and since the first thing everyone does is trade)</em>, Jupiter is the ideal spear tip for leading the charge, and we will need plenty of <strong>PIE</strong>:</p><ul><li>Products that r better than centralized versions</li><li>Incentives to attract masses to try the meta</li><li>Ecosystem of awesome projects on Solana</li></ul><p>Given the massive amount of PIE needed to convert the masses to the decentralized meta, I would like to align on the key ethos and ideas we need over the next few years in order to help the space generate enough PIE to make it happen.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="ethos-1-grow-the-meta">Ethos 1: Grow The Meta<a href="#ethos-1-grow-the-meta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ethos 1: Grow The Meta" title="Direct link to Ethos 1: Grow The Meta">​</a></h3><p>Over the last few interviews, I have always been clear about using Jupiter and JUP as a core leverage point for driving the decentralized meta.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1733348900113711610?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/0xMert_/status/1733348900113711610?s=20</a>
<a href="https://x.com/goodgamepodxyz/status/1732424198759600136?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/goodgamepodxyz/status/1732424198759600136?s=20</a></p><p>When people start to use Jupiter for whatever reason, they don’t just use Jupiter, they take a step into the increasingly unlimited potential of decentralized technologies - a world that’s so utterly different from the ones they are used to.</p><p>One thing that has been disappointing for me is engaging in conversations over the past 2 weeks where there were many airdrop recipients who had been extremely against starting the second growth airdrop purely for the reasons of being afraid that their own bags will be diluted - to the point of labeling new users as “airdrop farmers”, and calling themselves “loyal users”.</p><p>Protectionism sure starts early, but let’s not play into it. Careful and strategic emissions are of course crucial, that’s why we are fostering a tight culture of communicating strategy and getting feedback for every major phase, and why the interplay between the community and team is going to be crucial. </p><p>But to fight for your own bags exclusively so early in the game and to draw a line between users so early without consideration of the “grow the pie” ethos we need to set as well as the broader strategic vision is honestly not cool.</p><p>Also, it is my view that the max possible gains for the next couple of years will not be to focus on JUP utility, but rather brainstorming how to leverage JUP for maximum growth of Jupiter, Solana, and the decentralized meta - for the possible space is far, far bigger than we can imagine.</p><p>On that note, BONK is a really good example of what can happen when we take an expansive view of the universe, vs a constructive narrow perspective, for the universe strongly favors positive growth.</p><p>We will accept growing the meta strategically and pragmatically as one of our responsibilities - and JUP is one crucial leverage point we can use.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="ethos-2-build-a-secure-team">Ethos 2: Build A Secure Team<a href="#ethos-2-build-a-secure-team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ethos 2: Build A Secure Team" title="Direct link to Ethos 2: Build A Secure Team">​</a></h3><p>A cat that can hunt on its own is always going to be far more secure than a cat that needs to be fed constantly. </p><p>We would like Jupiter to be a world-class team that has strong revenues and hence operationally independent from the need to constantly fundraise for the sake of salaries and opex. That will set us up to be able to make the long-term decisions and build the amazing products that match up with our intentions to be a positive force for decades.</p><p>The core swap aggregation, which is a crucial part of Solana liquidity infrastructure, has always been and will always be completely free, much like Google’s search. In a DeFi first, we released the binary for free unrestricted usage 2 weeks ago, and will be taking more unprecedented steps next year to make it even more of a community resource.</p><p>Jupiter charges fees for limit orders, DCA, and perps and will keep these fees as team revenue. All fees will of course be tracked on-chain and fully visible on dashboards we will be publishing. Any investments made by team members have to be clearly reflected to avoid any semblance of conflicts of interest, particularly when it comes to Jupiter Start projects. I will personally refrain from making investments this year.</p><p>Due to the capped AUM for JLP, liquidity for perps can be rather limited at times, making it difficult to place positions. In addition, demand for JLP is extremely high, so the pool fills up extremely fast, in the matter of minutes every time we raise. </p><p>As a result, though, users are often unable to place positions and face rather high fees when placing positions. While we are working very hard to improve the system and increase the cap, being responsible and increasing the cap incrementally remains our top priority.</p><p>Thankfully, there are a range of excellent perp protocols on Solana, including <a href="https://twitter.com/zetamarkets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@zetamarkets</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/DriftProtocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DriftProtocol</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mangomarkets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@mangomarkets</a>, and many more upcoming ones like <a href="https://twitter.com/FlashTrade_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@FlashTrade_</a> - all of whom are our good friends, and we will do our best to encourage growth of the overall perp markets in Solana, not just our own, starting with an Educate program for Zeta next week.</p><p>In fact, after discovering the potential of on-chain perps on Jupiter, users are experimenting with various protocols, and learning what we have always known - Solana is by far the best place in crypto for on-chain perps, bar none. This will also get much better as liquidity on-chain increases exponentially over time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="ethos-3-help-the-solana-and-crypto-ecosystem">Ethos 3: Help The Solana and Crypto Ecosystem<a href="#ethos-3-help-the-solana-and-crypto-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ethos 3: Help The Solana and Crypto Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Ethos 3: Help The Solana and Crypto Ecosystem">​</a></h3><p>We do not see ourselves as a platform/product/protocol per se, but rather as a full-stack ecosystem push to help the Solana and crypto ecosystem win. </p><p>We will do so in 3 main ways:</p><ol><li>Help make Solana the most used blockchain</li><li>Provide full array of world-class trading products</li><li>Help new projects win via Jupiter Start</li></ol><p>We believe Solana is the best blockchain for onboarding the next billion users. And when we draw people to using Jup, they also end up using everything else on Solana.</p><p>And when we have a full set of powerful trading products that work as well as their centralized counterparts, they have no reason to go back to CEXes.</p><p>And when there is a critical mass of use cases and fun stuff you can do on-chain, there will be increasingly fewer reasons to pull your capital out.</p><p>Lastly, we can move the entire crypto space forward by being a shining example of what decentralized products, ethos and communities can do, hopefully playing a part in moving past the bad examples set by the last generation of fallen kings. </p><p>If not us, then who?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="no-cats-left-behind">No Cats Left Behind<a href="#no-cats-left-behind" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to No Cats Left Behind" title="Direct link to No Cats Left Behind">​</a></h2><p>Over the past 5 weeks, we have spent enormous effort on making sure that everyone involved so far will be part of the journey at the very beginning. There are 3 main groups: Mercurial Stakeholders, Jupiter Users and Community Contributors.</p><ol><li>Mercurial Stakeholders
For those who are unaware, Jupiter is a new project started when we were working on Mercurial <em>(which transited to Meteora on Feb 23)</em>. Here are a couple of posts summarizing the background:</li></ol><p><a href="https://twitter.com/0x__fp/status/1721491581872586992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/0x__fp/status/1721491581872586992</a>

We also communicated the decision accordingly both to early Mercurial investors as well as in the Meteora discord. </p><p><a href="https://meteoraag.medium.com/update-for-mercurial-stakeholders-as-of-feb-2023-2bf091627e52" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://meteoraag.medium.com/update-for-mercurial-stakeholders-as-of-feb-2023-2bf091627e52</a>

<a href="https://x.com/adidogCEO/status/1733658028509917215?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/adidogCEO/status/1733658028509917215?s=20</a></p><p>I aim to write a full blog post about the founding history of Jupiter next week, and the various twists and turns leading to where we are currently. A podcast with <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaLegend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SolanaLegend</a> focused on this historical period will  be released next week as well.</p><p>I deeply thank everyone who had been involved from day one, and particularly, the critical voices that have been instrumental in guiding us towards the final arrangement. Even if the criticisms have been extremely hard to swallow and felt very unfair at times, I doubt that I would have got it right if not for those voices.</p><p>Lastly, if you are a Mercurial stakeholder as of Feb 23, and you are not sure how to participate in the coming events, please reach out, we will spare no effort in making sure you are all caught up.</p><ol start="2"><li>10K Community Airdrops Review Requests
The other thing we have been spending a ton of time on is the 10 thousand community airdrop review submissions, and we are finally almost done, thanks to the ungodly effort put in by <a href="https://twitter.com/9yointern" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@9yointern</a>.</li></ol><p>AFAIK, we were the first project to openly debate the airdrop mechanism, to openly explain the criteria used, and also the first to open up a mechanism to allow people to protest the criteria. This is of course actually tremendously time-consuming and tiring, but we think it is an important process because we want to make sure we really tried our best to take into account every single point of view as well as do our best to address every complaint that came in.</p><p>The final allocations will be released tomorrow by   and there will be no more changes afterward. One thing here - do not harass our intern any further, regardless of your unhappiness. </p><p>She’s the most patient, anon-loving, SQL-churning, pepe-aware intern in the world, and everyone needs to appreciate the immense effort she put into it. We are normally pretty chill, but any mean messages will result in your airdrop being zeroed. Some things just cross the line, especially if someone super nice is trying her goddamn best.</p><p>Another major area of concern were also those with compromised accounts. There is no way to solve this totally elegantly, but what we will do for now is to not allow claiming on those wallets at the onset, and will likely have some kind of social media identification process and allowing claiming if there isn't any double claims.</p><ol start="3"><li>Community Contributors
Finally, next week there will be a site for anyone who has contributed meaningfully to Jupiter prior to Nov 2nd to connect their Twitter, Discord, and associated wallet address.</li></ol><p>Similarly, this part will take likely take 2-3 weeks to finish reviewing, and will be a tremendous use of effort on our end. But yet, as I mentioned in one of the recent podcasts - it is important for me because I would really like to recognize everyone who took the extra effort to help Jupiter out, even when we were just a product with absolutely no indications of rewards whatsoever.</p><p>It means a fuck ton to us, and I will try my best to make sure you are recognized in one way or another.🩷</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jup-for-jup">JUP FOR JUP<a href="#jup-for-jup" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JUP FOR JUP" title="Direct link to JUP FOR JUP">​</a></h2><p>At Breakpoint, I presented our <strong>“Grow The Pie”</strong> presentation and green paper. Ever since then, we have been flooded with an absolutely incredible level of feedback, and we are extremely grateful for the energy and enthusiasm that everyone have shown us. Of course, all the wens and airdrop demands can get pretty intense at times, but it's all part of the job.</p><p>To all the airdrop recipients, we are very grateful to be able to provide a present, and it is gratifying to hear from some of you regarding how it could being a really big difference in your life. That’s exactly what we are here for!</p><p>Also, I understand some of you are very anxious to claim it and maybe liquidate it for more stable assets. Don’t worry, it will happen soon in Jan, and we will do our best to make the whole process as seamless as possible and even make it as easy as possible for you to sell it or easily set the price you want for your JUP.</p><p>My only request is this - I hope you keep at least a bit of genesis JUP from the airdrop, because regardless of anything, you were an important part of the early journey. It will mean a lot to us if everyone involved at the beginning kept at least a bit of JUP with them. That way, we can keep in touch as we go through the coming years together.</p><p><em>Tokens are fungible, memories are not.🐱</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="grow-the-pie-update-2-jupiter-start">Grow The Pie Update #2: Jupiter Start<a href="#grow-the-pie-update-2-jupiter-start" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grow The Pie Update #2: Jupiter Start" title="Direct link to Grow The Pie Update #2: Jupiter Start">​</a></h2><p>At Breakpoint, we presented 3 major initiatives to grow the Solana Pie: $JUP, Jupiter Start, and Jupiter Labs. Today, after extensive discussions with the ecosystem, we are delighted to elaborate more about Jupiter Start.</p><p>For a long time, we have been wondering how we can encourage traction and awareness for great new projects while not accidentally promoting scams or being biased one way or the other.</p><p>It is crucial for ecosystems to strike the balance - new projects and tokens are literally the lifeblood of ecosystems, but hyping the wrong projects is probably the biggest breaker of trust for retail investors.</p><p>If we hit that balance though, we will be able to help good projects get more traction and awareness while making trading and investing more fun, trustworthy, and rewarding for users.</p><p>If we achieve that, we will also in essence be encouraging the safe, effective decentralized trading of new tokens, while helping the Solana ecosystem build more trust and connectivity.</p><p>Jupiter Start will be our year-long initiative to do so, banking on close collaboration with the community and ecosystem to help vet, debate, understand, and highlight great new projects.</p><p>The 5 aspects of Jupiter Start are:</p><ol><li>Jup Community Introductions</li><li>Jup Prelisting</li><li>Jup Educate</li><li>Jup Launchpad</li><li>Jup Atlas</li></ol><p>We will start piloting the first 3 as soon as next week, while the next 2 will be done next year, since they involve funds and will need to be more carefully designed. As with all pilots, we will be iterating and experimenting with the formats very frequently.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="a-jupiter-community-introductions">A. Jupiter Community Introductions<a href="#a-jupiter-community-introductions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A. Jupiter Community Introductions" title="Direct link to A. Jupiter Community Introductions">​</a></h2><p>Jupiter Community Introductions are to let Jupiter community members and users learn more about new projects and tokens in the Solana ecosystem.</p><p>Each introduction will last about a week, in which the project will be featured on our Discord forum. Projects will share key information about their idea, tokenomics, and key details like origination transactions and distribution of ownership.</p><p>Our community members will be able to help vet, understand, and discuss these projects. If the responses are positive and no red flags are found, we can spread the word further by tweeting about it and probably featuring it on our homepage.</p><p>Community members that <strong>prove</strong> expertise and thoughtfulness over time to their peers will also be able to earn corresponding rewards and recognition. </p><p>To kick this off, our first set of community introductions will be
<a href="https://twitter.com/OvolsNFT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@OvolsNFT</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/MyroSOL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MyroSOL</a>! </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="b-jupiter-pre-listing">B. Jupiter Pre-Listing<a href="#b-jupiter-pre-listing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to B. Jupiter Pre-Listing" title="Direct link to B. Jupiter Pre-Listing">​</a></h2><p>Jupiter Pre-Listing aims to allow new tokens to be safely traded on Jupiter by users. </p><p>The <em>token will show up in the token selector earlier, and the users can set limit orders at the price they want, perform DCA, etc.</em></p><p>Given that these are new tokens and liquidity will be very thin at the start, there will be lots of UI reminders and prompts to make sure the user knows what they are doing.</p><p>To ensure that these are not scam tokens, projects must be sufficiently known by the ecosystem, or need to post in a pilot forum in our Discord with sufficient time for our community to vet. Things like credibility are subjective, and we will iterate along the way. Obviously, tokens with misleading names similar to prominent projects or persons, or overlapped with the strict list will not be approved.</p><p>If you have a new token coming up, and want to make trading on Jupiter as easy as possible the moment the token is launched, let us know today!</p><p>If you’re a member of the ecosystem with expertise in evaluating various aspects of an early project — token distributions, legitimacy, etc. — let us know!</p><p>Pre-listings are NOT an endorsement of the project by Jupiter, merely a way to encourage a vibrant trading ecosystem. DYOR is extremely critical when investing in new tokens, be careful!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="c-jupiter-educate">C. Jupiter Educate<a href="#c-jupiter-educate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to C. Jupiter Educate" title="Direct link to C. Jupiter Educate">​</a></h2><p>Jupiter Educate is to let qualified traders and users of Jupiter learn more about great projects in the Solana ecosystem. The project will be featured on our social media as well as a section on our site. Qualified users and traders will be able to earn points or tokens by reading materials and performing certain on-chain actions.</p><p>With this initiative, we aim to have a sustainable, ongoing engine to let users know about great new on-chain projects, while also providing awareness and qualified active users for exciting new projects.</p><p>This will be a highly selective and customized process, and we will poll our communities ahead of time, and only projects with clear community support and strong ecosystem support will be part of this.</p><p>Pending a community poll, our first Educate partner will be <a href="https://twitter.com/ZetaMarkets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ZetaMarkets</a>, an awesome perps exchange platform and a great friend of Jupiter!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="d-launchpad-and-atlas">D. Launchpad and Atlas<a href="#d-launchpad-and-atlas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to D. Launchpad and Atlas" title="Direct link to D. Launchpad and Atlas">​</a></h2><p>Launchpad and Atlas are 2 funding-related initiatives to be launched next year. Launchpad will help projects get community and their token launched, Atlas to allow the community to partake in VC-style seed funding for early-stage projects. Whenever funding is involved, it obviously becomes a lot more complicated, so we will be taking our time with these, while also applying some of the lessons.</p><h1>Community-Driven Approach</h1><p>As with all our key initiaitives, we are committed to doing these in conjuction with the community and doing it in a way that greatly enhances the trust of users in the Solana ecosystem.</p><p>If you fall into any of the following categories:</p><ol><li>A user with strong interest in vetting projects and understanding tokenomics</li><li>A project looking to launch a new token or idea</li><li>A community leader looking to connect new projects with your community</li></ol><p>Please get in touch with <a href="https://twitter.com/benliewxyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@benliewxyz</a>, and we will try our best to involve you! By the way, due to the extremely high demand from projects to be featured or supported for Jupiter Start, we apologize if we cannot accommodate all.</p><p>The most challenging thing about this whole endeavor is defining what 'good' means and who gets to decide that. </p><p>As such, we are designing Jupiter Start in a way such that the team is not the only entity involved in the process – instead, the community will play a leading role in proposing, deciding, or vetoing these endeavors.</p><p>Let's make Solana and crypto a better place for both good new projects and users - our moms will be very proud if that happens!</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grow The Pie Update 1: Community Airdrop]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="grow-the-pie-update-1-community-airdrop">Grow The Pie Update #1: Community Airdrop<a href="#grow-the-pie-update-1-community-airdrop" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grow The Pie Update #1: Community Airdrop" title="Direct link to Grow The Pie Update #1: Community Airdrop">​</a></h2><p>Here’s the breakdown for the first round of the community airdrop, along with a detailed rationale about how we arrived at it.</p><p>We want to be as open as possible about explaining our thought processes, unique circumstances and data points we have gathered, and make sure that the airdrop is as understandable as possible, even the nuances of the discussion.</p><p>We take every part of the airdrop discussion very seriously, and we are immensely grateful for all the time and effort that everyone put in. Even if we cannot give everyone what they deserve or think is correct, I would like everyone who ever interacted with Jupiter to know that their usage/contribution was seriously considered.</p><p>An official airdrop allocation site will be up for everyone to check their stats and allocations.
That will conclude the current phase, moving us to the next phase of the JUP token launch. </p><p><strong>BASICS:</strong></p><ol><li><p>There will be 10B JUP Tokens. </p></li><li><p>As mentioned in our Breakpoint talk, this airdrop is to engage users who used us in the past, and invite them to be closely involved with the next phase of the Jupiter journey. Which means, the <strong>955K wallets</strong> who interacted with Jupiter directly before <strong>Nov 2nd</strong> are eligible for consideration. There will be future rounds of airdrops for new users, so stay tuned for that. </p></li><li><p>This is obviously a massive number of wallets, and with 35B of volume, how to slice it up to make it meaningful was always going to be a challenge, but we are gonna try our best.</p></li><li><p>All users who interacted with Jupiter via our many amazing integrations for example Solincinerator, Solendprotocol and all the wallets will be included in the airdrop if the transaction was signed directly by the user and we have that data.</p></li><li><p>Also as mentioned, 40% will be allocated to the community over 4 rounds of airdrops. 10% will be allocated in this round, which will be 1B tokens. We expect to start one more round of growth oriented airdrop before token launch.</p></li><li><p>We have never announced or even hinted at any form of airdrop or even token until a couple of days pre-breakpoint. All growth has been purely organic. There was no massive increase in wallets in those few days, so there’s no reason to think that we were massively spammed. Therefore, de-duplication is not a particular area of concern for us, but will definitely be for future rounds.</p></li><li><p>All previously published dashboards and criteria were from 3rd parties. While certainly a good proxy, we are taking into account a much wider set of data points and nuances into consideration. So do wait for the official site to check both the volume, score and allocation. </p></li><li><p>First round allocations will be up to check but tokens will not be live yet. There are several phases to the token launch, which we covered in the breakpoint talk and we will share more later on.</p></li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="perspectives">PERSPECTIVES<a href="#perspectives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to PERSPECTIVES" title="Direct link to PERSPECTIVES">​</a></h3><p>There were many extremely different perspectives and proposals being floated over the last week, with 2 major directions, the first being a completely even distribution, and the other being a completely volume based distribution. There were also many great proposals that aimed to strike a balance, and we took inspiration from many of those.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="data">DATA<a href="#data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DATA" title="Direct link to DATA">​</a></h3><p>Based on these feedback and ideas, we looked into the data in a lot of  detail, which you can see in the attached image.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GrowThePie1" src="/assets/images/growthepie1-9799ba61be103ef8720d5bf16396decb.jpeg" width="2518" height="768" class="img_MG2L"></p><ol><li>Massive Power Law At Play
The most important data point here is the massive power law in terms of trading volume. 0.1% of wallets account for 60% of volume, while 0.2% account for 80% of volume. Even within the 0.2 tier, there are non-bot users that account for 240M of volume, far more than the average user in this elite tier. Conversely, the lower 70% accounts for much less than 1% of volume. </li></ol><p>A linear (or even quadratic) proportion based on volume will not work for a good distribution, even for relatively power users with &gt;100k or &gt;1M of volume. We did not want to overcomplicate it with fancy maths too much <em>(base x logs)</em>, so we opted for a reasonable tier method instead that will ensure that no one will get way too much or too little.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>Bigger wallets were more active before 2022, while smaller wallets were more active after 2023.
A larger number of the bigger wallets turned out to have used it mostly before 2023, while smaller wallets were more active in 2023. This suggests that a multiplier for 2023 volume will have the effect of bumping up small wallets into higher tiers.</p></li><li><p>Stable/xSOL-SOL/Bot volume were more significant at the highest levels
One interesting observation was that stable/xSOL-SOL/bot volume was far higher at the highest levels. For example, the 2 wallets that did &gt;500M in volume were purely arb traffic. While our share of user volume has greatly increased over time, arb bots consisted of a fairly large volume, especially early on in the cycle. </p></li></ol><p>To be clear, there are many kinds of bots, and many of them play an important part in the liquidity ecosystem, so this is an observation to open up the conversation about whether to differentiate between these volumes.</p><p>There are many other interesting observations not covered above, but feel free to join our discord and chat more!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="airdrop-breakdown">AIRDROP BREAKDOWN<a href="#airdrop-breakdown" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AIRDROP BREAKDOWN" title="Direct link to AIRDROP BREAKDOWN">​</a></h2><p>With these in mind, we would like to present the airdrop breakdown for the first 10%.</p><ul><li>Even distribution for all wallets <em>(2%)</em></li><li>Tiered score based distribution, with score based on  adjusted volume <em>(7%)</em></li><li>Community members on discord, twitter, developers <em>(1%)</em></li></ul><p>We believe this breakdown will reward power users and contributors significantly more, while likely giving everyone else a reason to come back and engage. </p><p>Let me dive into each of these categories:</p><ol><li>Even distribution between all wallets <em>(2% / 200M tokens)</em>
While not using volume as the major criteria was always going to be a non-starter, we also greatly appreciated the point that we should aim to be as inclusive as possible to maximise the community building potential here, and bring as many people back as possible regardless of volume.</li></ol><p>As such, we are allocating 200M tokens, which means about 200 tokens for each account, which would be a nice welcome present if Jupiter does well. For those who have not tried out Jupiter or Solana for a long time, do come back and try us out again - lots have changed!</p><p>We are not de-duplicating here for reasons mentioned above. We have never announced an airdrop before, and neither did we see a huge influx of wallets at any point in time, so we think it's more important to have everyone included, vs performing opaque methods of deduplicating.</p><ol start="2"><li>Tiers Based On Adjusted Volume Score <em>(7% / 700M Tokens)</em>
The vast majority of tokens in this drop will be allocated towards a tier based scoring system, with adjusted volume being the main point of reference. </li></ol><p>Here’s where we leave the simplistic into the much more nuanced landscape of allocating based on how much they engaged with the network, how much they used Jupiter in during the bear market, and the nature of the volume.</p><p>Based on the <strong>NON-ADJUSTED</strong> volume, we will be looking at approximately:</p><ul><li>Tier 1: Top 2K users, 100,000 tokens each (est &gt;1M trading vol)</li><li>Tier 2: Next 10K users, 20,000 tokens each (est &gt; 100K trading vol)</li><li>Tier 3: Next 50K users, 3000 tokens each (est &gt; 10K trading vol)</li><li>Tier 4: Next 150K users, 1000 tokens each (est &gt;1K trading vol)</li></ul><p>It is important to remember that we are using these volume numbers as a proxy, since the final tiering will be based on the top X users in the given tiers based on adjusted volume.</p><p>The adjustments will likely be the following:</p><ul><li>multipliers for 2023 volume (likely counted 2X or 3X)</li><li>zeroing of arb volume (defined as samemint - samemint txns)</li><li>removing of known accounts (for example wormhole exploiter)</li></ul><p>So, someone who traded mainly in 2022 but disappeared in 2023 will likely be dropped in tier, while someone active throughout 2023 will likely gain in tier. </p><p>One question that we are going to leave open will be whether to discount stable, xsol-sol and bot traffic.</p><p>The obvious flaw with this approach is simple - the tiers are pretty broad, tiering is kinda sorta unfair to those who just missed out on the past tier. For example, even in tier 1, you have a user who traded 240M in volume vs the average of 1M traded in that tier.</p><p>We opted for this approach because as mentioned in the earlier section, there are massive power laws at work and we want to design a system where we get meaningful amounts of tokens into large numbers of active users of Jupiter, yet have it be meaningful for everyone if they do well.</p><p>This approach ensures that anyone who used Jupiter actively, particularly in 2023, will likely see their activity reflected in the various tiers. </p><p>And since this is a community building activity, not an academic exercise to have the mathematically perfect distribution, and I personally don’t like things that are not understandable by everyone this is what we opted for in the end. </p><ol start="3"><li>Community Contributors <em>(1% / 100M Tokens)</em>
Given that community contribution cannot be placed side by side with users, we have created a completely different allocation for discord contributors, Twitter supporters and developers. </li></ol><p>There will be multiple tiers here to reflect the level of contribution these amazing folks have in helping us become the platform we are today. We will have a preliminary list up next week, and allow people to submit additional requests as well. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="wrapping-up-the-community-airdrop-consultation">Wrapping Up The Community Airdrop Consultation<a href="#wrapping-up-the-community-airdrop-consultation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Wrapping Up The Community Airdrop Consultation" title="Direct link to Wrapping Up The Community Airdrop Consultation">​</a></h2><p>Hey all, wanted to share the main changes that we are making to the community airdrop after the last few days of very intense debates. We will also share important clarifications and explain some of the hotly debated decisions.</p><p>With this update, we are formally wrapping up the community airdrop consultation and will be focusing on getting the allocation checker website up and running asap.</p><p>This has been a long process for everyone, but we are seriously grateful for those who took the time and effort to chim in, and that we managed to talk to so many of you representing all various segments of Jupiter users.</p><p>Sorry that this update was a couple of days late - I wanted to make sure that anyone who is interested can understand the decisions and thought processes as much as possible.</p><ol><li>Changes made from first proposal
After talking to everyone, I agree that we missed out on certain important aspects around OGs n consistency. As such, there will be 3 main changes we are making from the initial proposal:</li></ol><ul><li>Acknowledge OGs who used the protocol in the first few months</li><li>Add a consistency modifier, with preference to those who have used Jupiter sufficiently over the last couple of years vs one off usages.</li><li>2023 volume multiplier only applies to older users who stayed on</li></ul><p>The exact details of these changes, as well as the end decisions on stables and bots will be shared on the interns wrap up the analysis of numbers and get the checker up and running.</p><ol start="2"><li>Important Clarifications</li></ol><ul><li>Tiers are based on adjusted scores, not volumes
The volume we indicated in my last post is to explain the guidelines as to how the tiers are derived.</li></ul><p>Therefore, there will NOT be a sharp volume based cutoff, but rather based on top 2000/10000/50000/150000 users based on the volume adjusted score.</p><ul><li>The 1% community allocation is for all contributors
The 1% community allocation is to allow us to have high levels of discretion for various types and levels of contribution that go far beyond volume. This includes developers, Twitter contributors, Discord, etc. We will have an initial list but also allow everyone to provide submissions on their contributions. This is similarly retroactive, so only contributions made before nov 2 will be considered.</li></ul><p>Folks with Discord roles will be allocated something simple, but this allocation is mostly focused on contribution, which we will put in serious time and effort into reviewing to do justice to everyone who helped us above and beyond in debugging, promoting, moderating, etc. </p><ul><li>The coming website is an allocation checker site
The coming website is an allocation checker site. The token will go live later. We have a very clear token launch plan made up of 3 meows that we want to work closely with the community to execute.</li></ul><ol start="3"><li>Explainers on hotly debated decisions
We have to stand by certain hotly debated decisions, including the tiering system based on adjusted score, having an allocation for universal distribution, and the 2023 multipliers.</li></ol><ul><li>Bonuses for 2023 volume
Probably the hottest point of contentment was the 2023 multiplier, since it appeared to prioritize newer users rather than older users. The 2023 multiplier might seem arbitrary, so let me explain. Even though the price of SOL started tanking in 2022, 2023 <em>(after the ftx fallout)</em> was when we really saw on-chain activity drop dramatically, and belief in Solana has completely tanked.</li></ul><p>It is likely not a false statement to say that those continued to be active in 2023 is a big reason why Solana survived, and we want to acknowledge that. We continue to believe that a multiplier for 2023 volume is appropriate, but we will add in additional conditions to ensure that it applies only to old users who stayed on.</p><ul><li><p>No de-duplication for the even distribution
The lack of de-duplicating here for the even distribution is a concern for some, but the reason here is that it is extremely hard to de-dup without making use of tedious and opaque machine learning approaches, that is at the end of the day, not foolproof. We will avoid that to make this airdrop as understandable as possible. Having a min number of transactions is not ideal as well, since that rules out a lot of users who used us via integrations and we want to be as inclusive as possible for this part of the allocation. We will likely add more rules for this in future rounds of airdrops, but not in this one.</p></li><li><p>Disproportionate allocation for power users
Many people have critiqued that power users will get a disproportionately large amount of the airdrop. However, this difference is actually much smaller compared to the difference in volume, which is closer to 1000x or even as large as 240,000x. So the extremes have actually been very much nerfed, while still making it meaningful per tier. It also encourages usage instead of farming via multiple wallets.</p></li><li><p>Disparity in same tier
Conversely, some users within the same tier have also commented why given their volume, they might get the same as someone who traded less. The difference in volume within a tier might seem big until you comprehend the massive power law at work, where a non-bot single whale can trade 240M, and 0.2% accounts for 80% of the volume even with bots excluded.</p></li><li><p>Just missing out on tiers
We understand that like airline mileage tiers, it sucks to just miss out on a tier, and we sincerely apologise for that, but this is the best we can do at the moment to prevent an overly top heavy distribution, while making it meaningful for people in each tier, and keeping the overall system relatively simple.</p></li></ul><ol start="4"><li>Reflections on the community consultation
As mentioned, this post formally ends the consultation period for the airdrop.</li></ol><p>Next steps:</p><ul><li>A site will be up soon with official criteria, scores and allocations.</li><li>There will also be a place for users to submit their pre-breakpoint community contributions</li><li>We will share some thoughts on this process of community consultation for airdrops, and how the process will be updated for the next few rounds.</li></ul><p>Thanks again to everyone for being part of this process. We know it has been extremely tiring for everyone. For us, this retroactive airdrop is a once in a lifetime chance to work with all the amazing users who have been part of our journey, so we are deeply appreciate the change to engage with everyone.</p>]]></content>

We want to invite you to engage in dialogue with us, and contribute to shaping the future of Jupiter and its role within the Solana ecosystem. </strong></p><p>We will be also introducing for the first time <strong>$JUP, Jupiter Start and Jupiter Labs</strong>. We hope that the details in here will serve as a catalyst for fruitful discussions. </p><p>Today, Jup.ag is the default destination for traders on Solana. We have the best aggregator in crypto and the most seamlessly integrated platform in Solana – powering a variety of trading activities, including but not limited to swaps, limit orders, dollar cost averaging strategies and more ... </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="2023-building-the-best-decentralised-trading-experience">2023: Building the Best Decentralised Trading Experience<a href="#2023-building-the-best-decentralised-trading-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2023: Building the Best Decentralised Trading Experience" title="Direct link to 2023: Building the Best Decentralised Trading Experience">​</a></h2><p>In the depths of the bear market in November 2022, we decided to double down on Solana. The collapse of FTX underscored the urgent need for a trustless alternative to centralised exchanges (CEX). And we believe that Solana, with its high-performance capabilities and robust community, is the best blockchain for this endeavour. </p><p>Our commitment was met with prolific shipping throughout 2023, as we successfully launched an array of new routes, innovative products, and better developer infrastructure. For example:</p><ul><li>Our routing improvements include the launch of Metis – a novel routing algorithm that was customised for Solana’s fast blocktimes.  We also launched instant staked SOL to SOL swaps that gives you the best price across all trade sizes. </li><li>Our product portfolio expanded to include Dollar Cost Averaging(DCA), Limit Orders and a Bridge Comparator. </li><li>Our developer tooling improved with 2 major API Upgrades, Jup for Payments &amp; Games, and the Jupiter Terminal. </li></ul><p>A full list of our products and product announcements can be found on our <a href="https://station.jup.ag/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation website</a> and <a href="https://station.jup.ag/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a>.  </p><p>By the end of October 2023, we facilitated a cumulative trading volume of $35 billion, executed 102 million transactions, and were used by 955,000 unique wallets, solidifying our position as the most used trading platform. We account for the majority of retail flow, with approximately 80% of organic swap volume originating from Jupiter. </p><p><a href="https://station.jup.ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Feedback from our user community</a> has been overwhelmingly positive, with many highlighting that the superior pricing and exceptional user experience provided by Jupiter were surpassing those offered by traditional centralised exchanges. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="core-anchors-for-excellence-in-product-development--ecosystem-enhancement">Core Anchors for Excellence in Product Development &amp; Ecosystem Enhancement<a href="#core-anchors-for-excellence-in-product-development--ecosystem-enhancement" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Core Anchors for Excellence in Product Development &amp; Ecosystem Enhancement" title="Direct link to Core Anchors for Excellence in Product Development &amp; Ecosystem Enhancement">​</a></h2><p>The progress and innovations at Jupiter can be attributed to three core anchors that guide every decision and strategy we undertake:</p><ol><li><p><strong>The JUP Promise: Best Price, Best Token Selection, Best UX: </strong>This deceivingly simple and straightforward promise is the driving force behind our obsessive efforts in product innovation. From enhancements in routing algorithms to the integration of new tools, they are all aimed at delivering an exceptional trading experience for both users and developers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Maximising the Potential of Solana’s Technical Capabilities: </strong>Much like harnessing the full potential of a high-performance vehicle, we strive to make the most of Solana’s capacity for providing swift and efficient trading experiences. Jupiter has been at the forefront of adopting new Solana features such as lookup tables, priority fees, and token 2022 standards.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improving the liquidity landscape in Solana:</strong> We are committed to the rapid integration of new liquidity sources and innovative use cases, ensuring the continual growth and competitive edge of the Solana ecosystem.</p></li></ol><p>These anchors have been instrumental in the development and launch of various products at Jupiter. A prime example is <a href="https://station.jup.ag/blog/jup-v3-metis-routing-algo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metis, our advanced routing algorithm</a>, which is a heavily customised version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm designed to provide optimal price routing in Solana’s fast block-times.</p><p>It guided us to prioritise the integration of Sanctum,<a href="https://station.jup.ag/blog/jup-lst-with-sanctum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> facilitating instant staked SOL to SOL conversions at the most favorable rates</a>, irrespective of the trade size. This helps to accelerate the adoption of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) within the ecosystem, and paves the way for new composable innovations.</p><p>Furthermore, we introduced the bridge comparator, a tool that allows users to seamlessly compare and select the most efficient bridge for transferring tokens from other chains to Solana, so that we can help to bring more capital to Solana.</p><p>Most recently, during the <a href="https://station.jup.ag/blog/jup-plantary-dev-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupiter Planetary Developer Week</a>, we unveiled a plethora of new features, including the V6 Swap API, Jup for Payments, and the upgraded Jupiter Terminal V2.</p><p>Having provided an insight into our recent product developments, you might now be curious about our future plans and directions.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="help-solana-grow-aka-grow-the-pie">Help Solana Grow aka Grow the Pie!<a href="#help-solana-grow-aka-grow-the-pie" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Help Solana Grow aka Grow the Pie!" title="Direct link to Help Solana Grow aka Grow the Pie!">​</a></h2><p>Our vision for the future is intrinsically tied to the growth and prosperity of the Solana ecosystem. We are driven by the conviction that a flourishing Solana ecosystem translates to collective benefits for all stakeholders involved. In simple terms, when the pie grows, everyone gets more pie.</p><p>In alignment with this vision, we are excited to introduce The Jupiter Plan, a strategic framework encompassing three pivotal components: </p><ol><li><p><strong>$JUP Governance Token:</strong> Our goal is to cultivate a robust community and DAO for Jupiter. We also aim to incentivize engagement and new capital flows into the Solana ecosystem, thereby fostering its growth and vibrancy. NOTE: $JUP is not live yet, please beware of fake tokens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jupiter Start</strong>: This is a year-long initiative designed to help great new projects win on Solana, with a focus on projects that contribute to the health of the Solana ecosystem, not short term pump and dumps. There will also be a commitment to transparency and public seeding, so that the community can invest in good projects early on without gatekeeping.</p></li><li><p><strong>Jupiter Labs:</strong> In collaboration with our community and the JUP DAO, we will launch cutting-edge decentralised finance (DeFi) projects specifically tailored for the Solana ecosystem. We have 2 new initiatives to introduce – a novel LP-to-trader perpetual exchange, and a xSOL leveraged stablecoin.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jup-unveiling-our-governance-token-"><strong>$JUP: Unveiling our Governance Token </strong><a href="#jup-unveiling-our-governance-token-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to jup-unveiling-our-governance-token-" title="Direct link to jup-unveiling-our-governance-token-">​</a></h2><p>NOTE: $JUP is not live yet, please beware of fake tokens.</p><p>We are thrilled to formally announce the impending launch of the $JUP token, a milestone that our community has been keenly anticipating. Our approach to introducing the JUP token has been deliberate, and we believe that the conditions are now optimal for its launch, as several key pieces are falling into place: </p><ul><li>Having a broad and engaged user base</li><li>Completion of major platform upgrades</li><li>Having a pipeline of ecosystem projects</li><li>Strong belief in the coming upswing of Solana </li></ul><p>The primary objectives of launching the JUP token are to:</p><ul><li>Energise the ecosystem by attracting new capital flows and users to Solana. We aim to attract new investments, users, and capital to Solana, contributing to its overall growth and vitality.</li><li>Generate momentum for new ecosystem tokens: The JUP token can help to catalyse the momentum for more new ecosystem tokens.</li><li>Build a Strong and Distributed JUP Community: We are focused on establishing a robust and broad community that is engaged and committed to supporting crucial initiatives in the long term.</li></ul><p>JUP will be a Governance token. Initially, the token will be locked, and the DAO will decide the exact unlock date. JUP token holders will have the ability to vote on critical aspects of the token itself, such as the timing of initial liquidity provision, future emissions beyond the initial mint, and key ecosystem initiatives, including determining the projects that will be a part of Jupiter Start.</p><p>For the initial supply of tokens, the proposed allocation will be as follows:</p><ul><li>40% Community Growth (4 rounds of airdrop distribution)</li><li>20% Locked Token Sale </li><li>40% Team &amp; strategic reserve (vested)</li></ul><p>There will be 3 parts to the launch phases; the Community Airdrop, the Growth Airdrop and the Locked Token Sale. </p><p><strong>Initiating a 2 week consultation period for airdrop mechanics</strong></p><p>Traditionally, the mechanics of airdrops are unilaterally determined by the team, with the community subsequently informed of the decision. This often leaves limited scope for discourse or community input.</p><p>In our quest to foster a more collaborative ecosystem, we are opting for an alternative approach, where the community plays an integral role in shaping the mechanics of the upcoming airdrop. This green paper does not lay out the specifics of the airdrop criteria. Instead, starting from today, we are initiating a two-week consultation period, during which we invite open dialogue and contributions from all community members. </p><p>We want to devise a plan that resonates with the values of the community, so that we can own this journey together and be proud shared owners of JUP.</p><p><strong>Community Airdrop</strong></p><p>For the first round of community distribution, we propose an airdrop for existing users and community members to reinvigorate the community and give everyone a stake in the JUP and Solana. Given that 955,000 users have used Jupiter before, this will be one of crypto's biggest organic airdrops. As it has been a very challenging (and often painful) year, we suggest prioritising users who have been consistently part of Jupiter and Solana throughout the whole time, especially the most bearish times. </p><p><strong>Growth Airdrop</strong></p><p>In the Growth Airdrop phase, we will see the formation of the DAO that will help decide on the Token Launch. In addition, the second round of our community distribution has a growth-centric focus, with the primary objective of attracting new users and enhancing liquidity within the Solana ecosystem. </p><p>We will reward trading on Jupiter and Solana to incentivise users to trade more actively. Moreover, we are anticipating the emergence of a new wave of promising ecosystem tokens early next year, and we want to drive as much focus and attention to these tokens as possible. It is crucial that users who are incentivised to start trading on Solana again can appreciate the significant strides made by Solana in terms of ux and ecosystem growth. We look forward to experimenting with the community and ecosystem on this!</p><p><strong>Locked Token Sale Phase</strong></p><p>To reinvigorate the public sale market of Solana, we are initiating a Locked Token Sale (LTS) phase for 20% of tokens. In order to make it as egalitarian as possible, there will be no exclusivity in terms of whitelisting nor early access, providing an equitable opportunity for all. </p><p>Tokens acquired in this sale will be locked, but they will confer voting rights upon the holders. This includes the ability to vote on pivotal decisions such as determining the initial liquidity date of the token. Consequently, participants in the token sale will effectively become the inaugural members of the DAO, playing an integral role in shaping its direction.</p><p>Over the public LTS and 2 rounds of community distribution, our objective is to cultivate a DAO that is not only highly engaged but also eagerly invested in the success and prosperity of Solana. </p><p>This approach represents a deliberate shift away from prevailing narratives of retail investors being disadvantaged, insider dominance, high FDV &amp; low float token launch games, and uncertainties surrounding token emissions in Solana. Instead, we are championing a model of transparency and equitable participation – our airdrops and token sales have no insiders and no centralised voting, a high float from the start, and diverse investors that include previous users and new users. </p><p>By granting the DAO the authority to determine subsequent community distributions and sanction future mints, we cement a system that guarantees full transparency of emissions. The role of the DAO will also be growth centric, collaborating not just on the current initiatives but also to grow new world class products in the future.</p><p>There is a very clear distribution of roles between the team and the DAO - The team manages products, protocols, and development, while the DAO manages one of the most crucial aspects - token distribution &amp; future emissions. </p><p>The entire initial supply belongs to community participants through the token sale, airdrops, and growth incentives, while the team’s allocation will be vested over 2 years. The strategic allocation (for potential future investors and talent) can only be used by the team at least a year after token liquidity, and there will be at least 6 months notice before any tokens are released from this pool.</p><p>Our aim is to energise the Solana ecosystem by driving investment, users and capital to Solana, generate more momentum for new ecosystem tokens and build up a strong and focused Jupiter community to help improve Solana. </p><p>Together, we work towards a future where the victories of Solana translate to victories for all. Solana wins, everybody wins!</p><h1>Jupiter Start</h1><p>Jupiter Start is a year-long initiative that seeks to redefine the launchpad experience, placing a strong emphasis on the long-term success and sustainability of new projects within the Solana ecosystem. We believe that for a project to truly thrive, it requires more than just a successful token launch; it needs a robust community, ongoing momentum, and strong visibility from investors.</p><p>New projects are essential for invigorating new ecosystems, and this underscores the significance of launchpads. However, the current landscape of existing launchpads leaves much to be desired. Their predominant focus tends to be on short-term token price gains, often neglecting the long-term viability and sustainability of projects. This short-term approach is further compounded by the absence of an engaged and supportive community, which is integral for the flourishing of any project. </p><p>Most fundamentally, launchpads today seem more focused on pumping the value of their own platform token rather than genuinely supporting new projects and the crypto ecosystem, with unfair advantages given to insiders and the encouragement of FOMO and speculative behaviour that leads to tokens dumping quickly post-launch. </p><p>The crypto industry is at a point where the need for real-world use cases, trustworthiness, and long-term sustainable projects has become more apparent than ever. There is a strong desire among community members and investors to contribute to projects that show promise and innovation. After all, the beauty of crypto is the ability of anyone to be involved in the entire value creation as early as possible. At the same time, new and legitimate teams are in need of support in terms of users, community engagement, and financing to build momentum and bring their visions to life.</p><p>Also, crypto needs a lot more use cases and trust worthiness. Two of the most prominent criticisms of crypto have been that there are no real use cases for real world adoption and that the prevalence of scams and rugs erode trust among retail investors. </p><p>With one of the most highest level of active developer participation, technical platform suitable for mainstream adoption, and invaluable experience from the dangers of short-termism, we believe that Solana is the perfect place to usher in a new era for crypto - focused on new use cases and long term thinking that is so very much needed.</p><p>Jupiter Start will be made up of 3 core components, which will be incrementally launched over the next few months.</p><ol><li><p>Jupiter Token Spark: This initiative is committed to demystifying new tokens, simplifying the complexities associated with token launch, and ensuring immediate tradability on Jupiter. We highlight exceptional projects, providing them with visibility within our community and DAO. </p></li><li><p>Jupiter Launchpad: We aim to address the current inadequacies of launchpad models, concentrating on fostering long-term alignment, nurturing an organic community, maintaining ecosystem health, and integrating delegation features. </p></li><li><p>Jupiter Public Seeding: Our initiative supports communities in investing in new projects through a public venture capital funding model. This enables communal participation in seeding teams from day one, while incorporating crucial mechanisms such as vested funding.</p></li></ol><p>Jupiter is well positioned to do this for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><a href="http://jup.ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jup.ag</a> is the go-to platform for the most active traders, making it an ideal place to showcase and introduce new projects. </li><li>In conjunction with the launch of JUP, we are cultivating a broad and varied community, alongside a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO). This network is poised to actively engage with and participate in new ventures.</li><li>The JUP DAO can facilitate independent decision-making on project involvement, effectively mitigating potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, our extensive collaborations across the entire ecosystem position us to significantly contribute to and encourage cooperative efforts. </li></ul><p>The first component to be launched will be Jupiter Token Start, which will provide both a step by step guide to launching a token for immediate discovery and trading on Jupiter, as well as provide an avenue for the best projects to be discovered by the Jup.ag user base and JUP community, while offering potential investors and traders the chance to explore, interact and understand the new tokens. </p><p>These components set themselves apart from prior cryptocurrency initiatives with the following core values: </p><ul><li>100% transparency of end to end processes</li><li>Commitment to long term health of the Solana ecosystem</li><li>Inclusive participation regardless of token ownership</li><li>No insider advantage or preferential treatment</li><li>Co-development with the broader ecosystem </li><li>Clean, productive alignment of interests</li><li>Support for genuine user and community building</li></ul><p>We hope that Jupiter Start will illuminate Solana's significant advancements, showcasing it as a leader in progress, productivity, and ethical practices within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. And we want to work side by side with the projects, community and the broader ecosystem to achieve this!</p><h1>Jupiter Labs</h1><p><a href="https://station.jup.ag/labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupiter Labs</a> will debut top-tier DeFi protocols in partnership with Jupiter users, JUP DAO, and the Solana community. We aim to bolster Solana's DeFi ecosystem by nurturing new projects, leaders, and tokens. Although these initiatives will originate within Jupiter, they are ultimately designed to launch and operate independently.</p><p>Jupiter Labs is initiating two innovative projects which are at different stages of development: </p><ol><li><p><a href="https://station.jup.ag/labs/perpetual-exchange/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LP <!-- -->&lt;<!-- -->&gt; Trader Perpetuals</a>: This is a novel LP-to-trader perpetual exchange on Solana that offers up to 100x leverage. By utilising pool liquidity and oracles, it ensures zero price impact, zero slippage, and deep liquidity. Oracles enable stable market operations during liquidations and stop-loss events, removing risks of position bankruptcy and LP pool fund loss. Users can open and close positions in one simple step, eliminating the need for additional accounts or deposits. With Jupiter Swap integration, any Solana token can be used to open positions. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://station.jup.ag/labs/lst-stablecoin/litepaper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">xSOL Leveraged Stablecoin</a>: We propose sUSD, a new stablecoin backed by SOL and uses leveraged LSTs as the primary yield mechanism with protocol level dynamic rebalancing for stability. Borrowers can mint sUSD using SOL as collateral through interest-free loans with returns from the staked leveraged SOL covering the borrowing costs while providing annualised returns of 7~20% to sUSD holders. We suggest several mechanisms to further enhance the stability and utility of sUSD, including USDC-sUSD pool and various sUSD redemption mechanisms. </p></li></ol><p>These projects will be bootstrapped in conjunction with Jupiter users, the JUP DAO and the Solana ecosystem. Jupiter users will be granted priority access to test and benefit from incentives associated with these protocols and the JUP DAO will receive part of the protocol tokens. Crucially, we would invite knowledgeable members of the Solana ecosystem to be part of the process of community and protocol development early on, with community tokens allocated for this purpose. </p><p><strong>In Summary</strong></p><p>Crypto is in dire need of more users, an expansion of use cases, and an enhancement of trust. Solana is the perfect place for all 3 - It can be the most used, most useful and most trusted ecosystem. </p><p>Jupiter can help:</p><ul><li><strong>$JUP:</strong> Driving an increase in on-chain users and activity.</li><li><strong>Start:</strong> Broadening the spectrum of use cases and bolstering retail trust.</li><li><strong>Labs:</strong> Introducing innovative and impactful DeFi protocols.</li></ul><p>Together, let's shape a future where we don’t need CEXes anymore, where crypto is useful, and where your mum is proud of you for working in crypto.</p><p>Woohoo, LFG!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are excited to announce our plans to integrate Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(CCTP)</a> to bring native USDC to Solana powered by Wormhole. CCTP is a permissionless on-chain utility that ensures secure USDC transfers between blockchains using a native burn-and-mint process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="understanding-cctp">Understanding CCTP­­<a href="#understanding-cctp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Understanding CCTP­­" title="Direct link to Understanding CCTP­­">​</a></h2><p>Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is an on-chain utility designed by Circle. Its primary function is to enable the seamless transfer of USDC across various blockchains through a burn-and-mint mechanism. When users want to transfer USDC from one chain to another, CCTP burns USDC on the source chain and then mints a corresponding amount on the target chain. This process guarantees that the USDC's total supply remains consistent, preserving its integrity across blockchains.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="cctps-role-in-solana-and-jupiter">CCTP's Role in Solana and Jupiter<a href="#cctps-role-in-solana-and-jupiter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CCTP's Role in Solana and Jupiter" title="Direct link to CCTP's Role in Solana and Jupiter">​</a></h2><p>The imminent integration of CCTP into Solana marks a pivotal moment for Jupiter. With this integration, Solana's ecosystem stands to benefit from increased liquidity, reduced fragmentation from fewer wrapped USDC versions, and enhanced interoperability. By facilitating native USDC transfers within Jupiter, users are presented with the benefit of efficient, zero-slippage cross-chain transfers without ever departing from the Jupiter app interface.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="integrating-wormhole-connect-in-jupiter">Integrating Wormhole Connect in Jupiter<a href="#integrating-wormhole-connect-in-jupiter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integrating Wormhole Connect in Jupiter" title="Direct link to Integrating Wormhole Connect in Jupiter">​</a></h2><p>Wormhole has established itself as the industry standard for cross-chain messaging protocols, powering cross-chain applications. Currently, it connects over 30 leading blockchains. The Uniswap Foundation's bridge assessment committee recently recognized it as the industry’s top bridging provider, following an extensive security and decentralization <a href="https://uniswap.notion.site/Bridge-Assessment-Report-0c8477afadce425abac9c0bd175ca382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report</a>. By integrating <a href="https://wormhole.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wormhole Connect</a> into Jupiter, we offer users unparalleled access to liquidity across all major chains without the need to exit the Jupiter platform. This streamlined cross-chain capability not only elevates the user experience but also helps drive our product and community's growth.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="ending-notes">Ending notes<a href="#ending-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ending notes" title="Direct link to Ending notes">​</a></h2><p>Being the most used dapp on Solana, we are excited to bring this liquidity to all users in the ecosystem. Once the Solana CCTP goes live, this will be available on our UI, where users will be able to connect their non-Solana wallets and transfer their USDC into Solana with zero slippage regardless of transaction size.</p><p>This advancement promises unmatched liquidity for all Solana enthusiasts, extending Solana's unique features and advantages to other chains, heralding a new era of interconnectivity in the DeFi realm.</p><p>Stay tuned to our <a href="https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> for real-time updates on the launch of this integration.</p>]]></content>

It's an innovative new algorithm with real time streaming and discovery, with the routing engine also completely rewritten in Rust. This heavily modified variant of the Bellman-Ford algorithm incorporates key features such as incremental route building, combined route generation and quoting, and it's also future-proofed for much better scalability as we add more DEXes and tokens.</p><p>The previous version of the API utilized an older version of the algorithm that had significant limitations. Most notably, it did not provide efficient routing for large trades, which constrained its applicability for major use cases such as margin trading and liquidations. Moreover, it employed the former JavaScript engine, resulting in inconsistent API performance.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Planetary2" src="/assets/images/planetary2-f2178198eb3cd2417079afb67d49a72c.jpg" width="1220" height="780" class="img_MG2L"></p><p>With the v6 API now using Metis, all partners can enjoy a far higher level of liquidity for key use cases. For example, Solend which is using it for margin trading, where the trading amount is often much larger and requires deeper liquidity.</p><p>On the backend, we are constantly upgrading the API and making incremental improvements to deliver an easier, smoother and more efficient liquidity infrastructure for our partners.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="shared-intermediate-token-accounts-for-integration-simplification-and-cost-savings">Shared Intermediate Token Accounts For Integration Simplification and Cost Savings<a href="#shared-intermediate-token-accounts-for-integration-simplification-and-cost-savings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Shared Intermediate Token Accounts For Integration Simplification and Cost Savings" title="Direct link to Shared Intermediate Token Accounts For Integration Simplification and Cost Savings">​</a></h3><p>The idea of Shared Intermediate Token Accounts came about because there was an increasing number of intermediate token accounts to be created in order for a swap to be successful, which increased integration complexity and cost for users that needed to be addressed.</p><p>Previously:</p><ul><li><p>Integrators needed to create every single intermediate token account before integrating and obtaining quote routes, to make sure that the swaps were executed without any disruption. Any token accounts that were missed out would lead to swap errors.</p></li><li><p>In Solana, an account rent fee is incurred for every Solana account to store data on the blockchain. With a large number of intermediate token accounts to be created per protocol, users incur a sizable amount of rent.</p></li></ul><p>With the Shared Intermediate Token Accounts, Jupiter creates and maintains a set of Associated Token Account <em>(ATA)</em> contracts for intermediate token accounts. These shared accounts are global and shared among all protocols and partners integrated with Jupiter. Integrators now only need to ensure they have the final output token account to receive tokens for every swap.</p><p>On top of this, OpenBook Open Orders accounts are no longer required as well, because all orders accounts are also globally initialized and shared amongst integrators.</p><p>For instance, when swapping from Token A → Token B → Token C, instead of having to create accounts for Token B and Token C, integrators will only need to set up for the final out token <em>(Token C in this case)</em>. Any intermediate tokens in between, regardless of the number of token hops, are automatically initialized and managed by Jupiter’s pre-established shared token accounts.</p><p>Creating individual token ATA accounts incurs account rent fees, which accumulate over time due to the growing number of intermediate tokens. With fewer intermediate token accounts required, users benefit from not having to incur account rent fees for maintaining their individual token ATA accounts with each protocol they swap on.</p><p>We also see a much simpler integration process for partners and integrators, as the need to create and manage numerous intermediate token ATA accounts via route maps is eliminated.</p><p>Integrators can also better compose swap instructions that fit within a single transaction size limit, as the number of accounts to pass through in each instruction is streamlined with these shared ATA accounts.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="token-ledger-for-increased-swap-success-rates">Token Ledger For Increased Swap Success Rates<a href="#token-ledger-for-increased-swap-success-rates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Token Ledger For Increased Swap Success Rates" title="Direct link to Token Ledger For Increased Swap Success Rates">​</a></h3><p>It is very important to have a good swap success rate for a great experience for users as well as integrators. Token Ledger was developed because the common way of relying on simulation to facilitate swaps is not always reliable and can lead to swap failures especially during times of market volatility. A method that is based on actual amounts transacted, and combined into a single transaction is greatly needed, leading to the birth of The Token Ledger.</p><p>The Token Ledger is a collection of three instructions <em>(Set Token Ledger, Send Instruction, Swap Instruction)</em> that consolidate withdrawal and swap instructions into a single transaction. Integrators/partners can now effortlessly instruct a swap to be executed based on the actual sent amount, after taking into account fees and slippages.</p><p>Before the introduction of the Token Ledger, swap instructions relied on a simulation-driven approach to approximate the amount deducted from a user's wallet to facilitate the swap. This estimation approach often ended up with discrepancies between the estimated and actual amounts, especially during periods of market volatility with high slippages, leading to swap failures.</p><p>Consider this scenario where a user intends to withdraw 1,000 USDC from Meteora’s USDC vault into wBTC. Note that users hold vUSDC LP tokens in Meteora vaults.</p><ol><li>In the first instruction, the Token Ledger will verify and record the user’s initial USDC balance within their wallet. For the purpose of this example, let’s assume the initial balance is 100 USDC.</li><li>In the second instruction, an amount equivalent to 1,000 USDC in vUSDC is withdrawn from Meteora vaults into USDC, and we examine the user’s balance. Due to factors like slippage, the USDC balance is found to be 1090 USDC.</li><li>For the third instruction, subtracting the initial 100 USDC from the current 1090 USDC balance, it’s evident that the user has effectively withdrawn 990 USDC, which will then be utilized to swap for wBTC as the final output token.</li></ol><p>Without the Token Ledger, the previous swap method relied on estimated amounts, which could fluctuate due to market volatility and performance variations, frequently resulting in suboptimal user experiences.</p><p>With the Token Ledger, integrators can issue swap instructions based on actual amounts that have taken into account slippage and related fees. This eliminates the need for simulation and significantly increases the success rate of swaps, all within a single transaction.</p><p>The Token Ledger caters to a wide range of use cases, which include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Withdrawing assets from a protocol to any desired token, such as converting to USDC from a wBTC vault.</li><li>Supporting protocols that transition positions to a different token from their original position, as seen in Perpetuals.</li><li>Facilitating the exchange of NFTs for tokens other than SOL.</li></ul><p>Read more about the Token Ledger:

Distributing referral fees to Referrer A and Jupiter required adding two more accounts to the instruction. It was also challenging to accommodate varying percentages of referral fees for different partners, needing to pass more accounts into the instruction to calculate these fees.</p><p>The motivation behind building the referral fees system was to automate the process of calculating all these fees, while providing a user-friendly interface to set up referral accounts and claim the referral fees collected.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="referral-fees-system-features">Referral Fees System Features<a href="#referral-fees-system-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Referral Fees System Features" title="Direct link to Referral Fees System Features">​</a></h4><ul><li>Set up referral accounts with Jupiter via a simple interface requiring only a few clicks.</li><li>Only 1 single referral account is needed across the different Jupiter products.</li><li>Checking on the total fees collected across the token accounts with an easy button to claim them</li></ul><p>The partner journey is now hyper easy - They head over to Jupiter, create a referral account, and then plug the referral account parameters into their integration.

In Jupiter v6 API, we have made CPI calls much easier to use by turning transaction payload into instructions for API users.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="cpi-approach">CPI Approach<a href="#cpi-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CPI Approach" title="Direct link to CPI Approach">​</a></h4><p>To better understand how to swap via CPI, let us walk through an example of utilizing Jupiter Swap via CPI to swap from any tokens to SOL even if the user has insufficient SOL.</p><p>For CPI to work, the transaction will be composed of these instructions:</p><ol><li>Borrow enough SOL from the program to open a wSOL account that the program owns.</li><li>Swap X token from the user to wSOL on Jupiter via CPI.</li><li>Close the wSOL account and send it to the program.</li><li>The program then transfers the SOL back to the user.</li></ol><p>Read more here: <a href="https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/cpi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/cpi</a></p><p>The CPI approach is not without its limitations - because of Solana’s transaction limit of 1232 byte size, lookup tables cannot be used within a CPI call, swaps via CPI can fail at runtime since Jupiter routes may involve multiple DEXes in order to reduce price impact. Instead, we recommend taking the “flash-fil” approach to utilizing Jupiter Swap.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="flash-fill-approach">Flash-Fill Approach<a href="#flash-fill-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Flash-Fill Approach" title="Direct link to Flash-Fill Approach">​</a></h4><p>The “Flash-fill” approach is a way to integrate your program with Jupiter swap without the limitations of CPI. Flash-filling allows the use of Versioned Transactions in combination with Address Lookup Tables to include more accounts per transaction while keeping within the 1232 bytes limit.</p><p>To understand the Flash-Fill approach, we will walk through the same example of utilizing Jupiter swap via Flash-Fill to swap from any token to SOL even if the user has insufficient SOL. Note that Flash-Fill can facilitate swaps from any token to any token, not limited to SOL.</p><p>For Flash Fill to work, the transaction will be composed of these instructions:</p><ol><li>Borrow enough SOL from the program to open a wSOL account that the program owns.</li><li>Create the wSOL account for the borrower.</li><li>Swap X token to wSOL</li><li>Close the wSOL account and send it to the borrower.</li><li>Repay the SOL for opening the wSOL account back to this program.</li></ol><p>This approach entirely bypasses the need for CPI calls, effectively sidestepping the constraints imposed by CPI.</p><p>To delve deeper into these two approaches, check out our documentation here: <a href="https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/flash-fill" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/flash-fill</a></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="partners-using-v6-api">Partners Using v6 API<a href="#partners-using-v6-api" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Partners Using v6 API" title="Direct link to Partners Using v6 API">​</a></h2><p>A big shout out to our key early adopters for running our v6 API and helping us improve our stability and features.

Join us as we delve into the improvements we have made to our ExactOut API, and how we have been facilitating online and offline payments in recent months.</p><p>A big shout out to <a href="https://sollinked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sollinked</strong></a>, <a href="https://candypay.fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CandyPay</strong></a>, <a href="https://spherepay.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Sphere</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.hel.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Helio</strong></a> for integrating Jupiter swap into their payment systems. These are super exciting times as we break down the barriers separating the world of crypto from traditional finance.</p><p>So, without further ado, let's get started!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="exactout-v2-api-to-power-payments">ExactOut v2 API to Power Payments<a href="#exactout-v2-api-to-power-payments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ExactOut v2 API to Power Payments" title="Direct link to ExactOut v2 API to Power Payments">​</a></h2><p>ExactOut is an important feature, particularly in supporting payment use cases within any ecosystem. Jupiter's ExactOut API allows users to specify the precise amount of output tokens they require, with the input token amount being calculated accordingly. For instance, with ExactOut integrated, a protocol’s user can indicate they wish to receive exactly 100 USDC in exchange for SOL via Jupiter, instead of having to manually calculate and input the amount of SOL required to swap for an approximate amount of 100 USDC.</p><p>In the initial release of ExactOut v1, we could only support direct routes, limiting token selection and routing options that can be used. However, in Jupiter v6 API, our program has been updated to conduct on-chain calculations, thus enabling multi-hop routes for ExactOut v2.</p><p>This upgrade significantly broadens the range of supported routes from around 20 to over 400 trading pairs, enhancing route options and price selections. With 20 times more available price routes, aggregated across our partner platforms like Raydium and Orca, users can expect considerably better prices for their ExactOut swaps.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="how-exactout-is-used">How ExactOut is used<a href="#how-exactout-is-used" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How ExactOut is used" title="Direct link to How ExactOut is used">​</a></h3><p>ExactOut is particularly useful in scenarios involving the purchase of NFTs, allowing users to make payments with any tokens they possess. To illustrate, let's consider a situation where an NFT Marketplace has integrated ExactOut on its platform. You wish to buy your favorite NFT which is priced at 40 SOL, but most of your liquid assets are in BONK. Without ExactOut, you would need to estimate the amount of BONK required to obtain 40 SOL and manually swap on an external platform to convert BONK into SOL.</p><p>The good news is that since the NFT Marketplace has integrated ExactOut into its interface, you can simply purchase the 40 SOL NFT and Jupiter swap would automatically calculate the most optimal amount of BONK required to purchase the 40 SOL NFT. This is achieved in a single click, eliminating the need to leave the site or perform additional calculations, while ensuring that you receive the best possible price through Jupiter.
This is extremely important to Solana as payments are a crucial part of bridging crypto with real-life applications, ultimately contributing to the mainstream adoption of the Solana ecosystem.</p><p>Read more about ExactOut here: <a href="https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/payments-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://station.jup.ag/docs/apis/payments-api</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="exactout-showcase-1---sollinked">ExactOut Showcase #1 - Sollinked<a href="#exactout-showcase-1---sollinked" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ExactOut Showcase #1 - Sollinked" title="Direct link to ExactOut Showcase #1 - Sollinked">​</a></h3><p>Sollinked is a social app designed for gated communities, offering a platform for newsletters or "paid" email inboxes that can be prioritized through incentives.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an important step towards building the most powerful and usable set of spot trading features in DeFi, we are thrilled to announce that <strong>Jupiter DCA is now officially launched!</strong> After many rounds of rigorous testing and user feedback, we have incorporated a ton of improvements based on valuable suggestions and ideas from partners and users to increase platform stability and add more features.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCALaunch" src="/assets/images/dcalaunch-bc5519a7939454f4b62254d93dd978cb.gif" width="600" height="403" class="img_MG2L"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jupiter-dca-recap">Jupiter DCA Recap<a href="#jupiter-dca-recap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Jupiter DCA Recap" title="Direct link to Jupiter DCA Recap">​</a></h2><p>2 months ago, we launched the beta version of Jupiter DCA - a non-custodial, on-chain dollar cost-averaging solution to automate the purchase or sale of any token.</p><p>When you set up a DCA order, your chosen tokens get moved from your wallet to a special account owned by the DCA program. Imagine it like putting your tokens in a vault. The first order happens right after you create your DCA, and then more orders come in at the times you pick. So, if you're DCA-ing 1,000 $USDC into $SOL every day for 10 days, the first 100 $USDC -&gt; $SOL order goes through when you start, and you'll have 9 more daily orders to go.</p><p>Key use cases for DCA include:</p><ol><li>Bear market accumulation</li><li>Bull market profit taking</li><li>Splitting up large orders</li><li>Exiting low liquidity tokens</li></ol><p>To ensure the best price execution, DCA keepers use Jupiter and also perform price checks against an external price data provider i.e. Birdeye. In addition, to prevent people from querying and hijacking the order right before the order is about to be executed, orders have a + 2 ~ 30 seconds variability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="upgrades-from-beta">Upgrades From Beta<a href="#upgrades-from-beta" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Upgrades From Beta" title="Direct link to Upgrades From Beta">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Advanced Pricing Strategy:</strong> Introducing Min/Max parameters for users to define a precise, user-defined executable price range. This gives users more control over their investments and helps them avoid buying or selling at unfavorable prices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expanded Tradable Tokens:</strong> Now offering access to over 600 tokens listed on the Jupiter Strict Token List, giving users a significant increase in token selection from the initial Top 20 tokens.</p></li><li><p><strong>Any-to-Any Token Trading Pairs:</strong> Enabling trading between any-to-any token pairs for more diverse trading options.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metis Algorithm Implementation:</strong> Leveraging the Metis algorithm for enhanced routing and improved pricing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased Global Upper Limit:</strong> We have increased the global upper limit for a single DCA order from $5,000 USD to $20,000 USD. This change offers users more flexibility for a wider range of use cases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Default Slippage Rate for Improved Order Fulfillment:</strong> The default slippage rate has been adjusted to 10 basis points (bps) for an improved and better transaction fulfillment rate without disrupting the DCA flow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhanced Safety Mechanism with additional checks and warnings:</strong> Verifying scheduled date/time, token validation against the Jupiter Strict List, and issuing warnings for high price impact. Users can now see estimated price impacts for each cycle, and lower-cap tokens have more precise decimal market rates, with more warnings and banners to bolster the trading experience.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCA3" src="/assets/images/DCA(3)-58038edba6d3d26e8c1d4c3e9d9a54bb.jpg" width="1028" height="1218" class="img_MG2L"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="advanced-pricing-strategy">Advanced Pricing Strategy<a href="#advanced-pricing-strategy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advanced Pricing Strategy" title="Direct link to Advanced Pricing Strategy">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCAcomment1" src="/assets/images/DCAcomment1-54c0d6db38d97f81b033b738c5ec5619.jpg" width="1158" height="235" class="img_MG2L">

This feature is implemented at the contract level, empowering users to define a minimum price for selling and a maximum price for buying within their DCA orders, adding an extra layer of control for more precise order execution. This strategy ensures order execution within a user-defined price range. If the price falls outside the range during the execution, Jupiter will reattempt to fill your order at a later time till successful, while also enforcing our randomiser at a later time so your trade remains unpredictable. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCA2" src="/assets/images/DCA(2)-e7e7b6ba76821ed2522fd127d3237a94.jpg" width="1068" height="1518" class="img_MG2L">
<em>The example above sets both the minimum and maximum prices for the DCA order to be executed.</em></p><ul><li>Minimum price - $19 </li><li>Maximum price - $20 </li></ul><p>So in this scenario, if the <strong>SOL price is within $19-$20</strong>, the DCA will execute the order, and if it <em>falls below</em> or <em>pump above</em> the range, Jupiter will retry at a later time to try to check with the price, and if it is within the user-defined range, Jupiter will attempt to execute the order while enforcing our randomiser so your trade remains unpredictable.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCA4" src="/assets/images/DCA(4)-233de593d8df88ca8f4d1a5cd74c3973.jpg" width="984" height="1620" class="img_MG2L"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="expanded-tradable-token-selection">Expanded Tradable Token Selection<a href="#expanded-tradable-token-selection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Expanded Tradable Token Selection" title="Direct link to Expanded Tradable Token Selection">​</a></h2><p>Additionally, we've significantly broadened our range of supported tokens, expanding from the <strong>top 20 traded tokens on Jupiter's list to encompass over 600 tokens</strong>.

Unlike traditional LST &lt;--&gt; SOL pools that fragment liquidity, Sanctum services every staked pool with one SOL pool, enabling every stake pool token to be accessible across DeFi.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improved Validators Experience:</strong> Validators can easily launch stake-pools-of-one by tapping into Sanctum's shared liquidity. This reduces concerns about sourcing liquidity and unlocks a substantial portion of staked SOL for use in Solana's DeFi ecosystem.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competitive Pricing:</strong> Sanctum routing provides a pricing edge for smaller stake pool tokens and transactions, shifting away from heavy reliance on liquidity provision to AMMs.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="three-main-functions-on-jupiter">Three Main Functions on Jupiter<a href="#three-main-functions-on-jupiter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Three Main Functions on Jupiter" title="Direct link to Three Main Functions on Jupiter">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>SOL - xSOL:</strong> Direct staking through Sanctum, allowing SOL deposits into stakepools, with users receiving corresponding LSTs.</li><li><strong>xSOL - xSOL:</strong> Support for LSTs trading, with partial support for various xSOL routes.</li><li><strong>xSOL - SOL:</strong> Integration with Sanctum enables instant unstaking and liquidity access for staked SOL.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="benefit-to-the-ecosystem">Benefit To The Ecosystem<a href="#benefit-to-the-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefit To The Ecosystem" title="Direct link to Benefit To The Ecosystem">​</a></h2><p>LSTs have always held great potential for use by both users and DeFi protocols as a valuable source of yield. However, they've been hindered from mass adoption due to the challenge of instantly liquidating large LST amounts. Liquidity in standard markets is insufficient for large traders or liquidators who need rapid liquidity exit.</p><p>With this launch and integration, many of these problems are mitigated. Liquidators can now efficiently liquidate both small and large xSOL positions, leveraging Jupiter’s liquidity routes that include the Sanctum SOL reserve pool and other integrated liquidity sources instantly, with optimal prices and minimized price impact and slippage.</p><p>This unlocks LST adoption, introducing more tradable assets to Solana that can significantly increase TVL, unlock $9B in staked DeFi capital, and most importantly, enable protocols to maximize their capital efficiency and yield without typical cooldown or liquidity constraints. This pivotal step is a game-changer, and we eagerly anticipate the innovative products to be built upon this foundation.</p>]]></content>

By generating the routes for each split iteratively one after another, we can also use the same DEX in different splits - allowing us to find routes with better prices with more complex trades.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Metis2" src="/assets/images/Metis2-03a7d08ed027a50af4f8ed74c800d4d7.png" width="1200" height="675" class="img_MG2L"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="combine-route-generation-and-quoting">Combine Route Generation and Quoting<a href="#combine-route-generation-and-quoting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Combine Route Generation and Quoting" title="Direct link to Combine Route Generation and Quoting">​</a></h3><p>To improve the efficiency of the algo, we combine route generation and quoting into a single step, allowing us to avoid generating and using bad routes, which besides improving the efficiency, also allows us to use a larger set of tokens as intermediaries.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="future-proofing">Future Proofing<a href="#future-proofing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Future Proofing" title="Direct link to Future Proofing">​</a></h3><p>v2 runs fast when the total number of DEXs used is small since Solana limits us to use at most 4 DEXs in a swap <em>(due to the account lock limit of 64)</em>. Future Solana upgrades will relax this limit and allow more DEXs to be used in a single transaction. In addition, we foresee the continued growth of the Solana DeFi ecosystem, which means there will be many more DEXs emerging. </p><p>With Metis, we are well equipped to be able to handle both these trends, since the algorithm is able to scale to include more DEXs in a route when account lock limits are increased, and can support more DEXs with only a modest increase in running time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Metis3" src="/assets/images/Metis3-dae0e79b44a42caec8b0a7e0464be821.png" width="1102" height="601" class="img_MG2L"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="infra-upgrade">Infra Upgrade<a href="#infra-upgrade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Infra Upgrade" title="Direct link to Infra Upgrade">​</a></h3><p>In addition, determining the cost per hop for various amounts of splits is obviously a major challenge, since there are many potential outputs for different amounts, including for vastly different liquidity venues like CLOBs and CLAMMs, and getting quotes from lots of AMMs is slow, which limited the scalability of the system.  To resolve this, we embarked on a major infra upgrade to refresh quotes in parallel and in real time.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="performance-improvements">Performance Improvements<a href="#performance-improvements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Performance Improvements" title="Direct link to Performance Improvements">​</a></h3><p>The system has undergone rigorous testing over the past few weeks in production.

On Solana, the cost to the user will remain small and miniscule. </p><p>In addition, an great routing engine is crucial for DeFi in so many ways - liquidations require single transactions for large amounts to be as efficient as possible, new DEXs need a fair chance to be leveraged for volume as the more established ones, and of course, we need to keep on pushing the limits of Solana, so more people understand how powerful shit can get!</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="dca-dollar-cost-averaging">DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)<a href="#dca-dollar-cost-averaging" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)" title="Direct link to DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)">​</a></h2><p>Secondly, we are also delighted to introduce our DCA Beta, a non-custodial, on-chain dollar cost averaging solution to automate the purchase or sale of any token.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="DCA1" src="/assets/images/DCA1-52f4c46adef3aa59dedab233b0016d31.png" width="1200" height="675" class="img_MG2L"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="how-it-works">How it works<a href="#how-it-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How it works" title="Direct link to How it works">​</a></h3><p>If you choose to use USDC 900 to buy SOL daily over 9 days, 900 USDC will be transferred from your wallet to the non-custodial program and executed over the next 9 days.</p><ol><li>Your first order to sell 100 USDC for SOL will take place immediately at the best price available then.</li><li>Your second order to sell the next 100 USDC for SOL will take place approximately 24 hours after the initial order at the best price available then</li><li>Subsequently, 7 more orders will all take place approximately 24 hours after the previous order until the full DCA order has been executed. </li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="ease-of-use">Ease Of Use<a href="#ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ease Of Use" title="Direct link to Ease Of Use">​</a></h3><p>As with all Jupiter systems, we aim to make very complex transactions as simple as possible.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After rigorous testing over the past few weeks, <strong>Token2022 is now officially supported by Jupiter</strong>! <a href="https://fluxbeam.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluxbeam</a> has been integrated into our routing, and tokens like <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/CKfatsPMUf8SkiURsDXs7eK6GWb4Jsd6UDbs7twMCWxo?chain=solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$BERN</a> and <a href="https://birdeye.so/token/2kMpEJCZL8vEDZe7YPLMCS9Y3WKSAMedXBn7xHPvsWvi?chain=solana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$MOON</a> can now be traded along with other tokens in the Solana universe. </p><p>Token2022 is a new token standard developed by Solana Labs that presents a superset of functionality provided by the standard <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPL Token Library</a> which includes transfer fees, interest bearing tokens, non-transferability, and immutability. </p><p>This enables new types of tokenomics to be developed. For example, $BERN leverages a 6.9% transfer fee to reward holders of $BERN and $BONK while Solarmoon leverages transfer fees to reduce supply and create deflationary tokenomics for $MOON.</p><p>With the large number of updates over SPL Token Program, we had to make significant upgrades to our backend, UI and aggregator program to handle both the standard token library and token2022 in one seamless UX. Most notably, we had to support transfer fees across the entire stack and update our crawler to recognize Token2022 tokens.</p><p>In addition, as Jupiter is deeply integrated across many major wallets and dapps — not all of whom support 2022 yet — it was important for us to break this work out into a separate token list API as not to affect existing partners.</p><p>It’s important to note that Token2022 is currently still undergoing development and auditing. In addition, as features like transfer fees make it more difficult for integrators to adopt, we recommend sticking to the standard token library unless there is a strong need for those specific features.</p><p>To understand more about the standard, you can refer to these resources:</p><ul><li><a href="https://spl.solana.com/token-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://spl.solana.com/token-2022</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/KEMOS4BE/status/1663960214637539329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/KEMOS4BE/status/1663960214637539329</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/heliuslabs/status/1671551473950531585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://twitter.com/heliuslabs/status/1671551473950531585</a> </li></ul><p>We are really excited to support Token 2022 standards and can't wait to see the amazing things that projects cook up with these new possibilities.

We are designing this token list to be open, collaborative, and dynamic, to build a safer and more transparent trading experience for users and developers. </p><p>A key part of our <strong>JUP Promise (Best Price, Best Token Selection, Best UX)</strong> is the idea that users should be able to trade any token they want on Jupiter while having the peace of mind that the token they are trading is the right one. </p><p>This is super challenging in DeFi when the only true identifier of a token is its mint address, versus the more commonly human-referenced metadata of a project, such as its symbol, name, and icon, that can be impersonated. With new projects being created every day, it is not only difficult for protocols to police but it also creates a burden for users to be extra careful with what they're trading.</p><p>Having an up-to-date and trusted token list is crucial for both users and projects. Users depend heavily on the applications to display the right tokens. New projects want their tokens to be discoverable and tradable everywhere, whether they are famous or not. </p><p>In addition, a robust list should contain other types of data to give us the full picture of a token, including on-chain metadata from project creators, actual market liquidity, data from developers like Wormhole, SolanaFm, Birdeye, AllBridge, and community validation data.</p><p>With all these in mind, we would like to share how we addressed safety, openness, and the ability to trade any token while incorporating various sources of data into the token list.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="our-approach">Our Approach<a href="#our-approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our Approach" title="Direct link to Our Approach">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> The full list updates automatically with new projects as long as there is sufficient liquidity. This makes it available for trading on Jupiter immediately.</li><li><strong>Open:</strong> We include market and partner data about a token so you can choose what you need. The full list will always contain all tokens available for trade to give open access to all projects.</li><li><strong>Safety:</strong> Only validated tokens are shown on the 'Strict' list by default.</li><li><strong>Collaborative:</strong> We engage ecosystem partners to build a robust and comprehensive list with us by including their data. </li><li><strong>Community Driven:</strong> Our community drives the token-list validation process.</li></ol><p>For example, take this USDCet token symbol. </p><div class="language-typescript codeBlockContainer_EZCn theme-code-block"

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Jupiter, we are big fans of the BONK community and we deeply appreciate the energy it has brought to the Solana ecosystem.  We have also been strongly supportive of the community, including <a href="https://twitter.com/JupiterExchange/status/1610233682782212096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">burning the BONK fees</a> we collected from limit orders placed on our platform.</p><p>Late last week, we discovered that BONK tokens were airdropped to Openbook open order accounts rather than to the user accounts they were intended for. Since most traders use Openbook via Jupiter, a large portion of these tokens <em>(10T $BONK)</em> were airdropped to open order accounts managed by the Jupiter program. The full list of open order accounts and the respective accounts those were created for can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/Arrowana/8cadcc0c1ef11caabb2e5fd1f5471c11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Upon investigation, we realized that we would be able to potentially help the original targeted recipients retrieve the tokens by performing an upgrade to our program. We then reached out to the BONK core contributors to perform a full post technical post mortem and discussed what is the best plan forward. </p><p>Given the large amount of tokens at stake and the current phase of the market and ecosystem development, it appears that re-distributing all the tokens all at once might have the detrimental effect of causing a crash that might be hard to recover from, which will benefit no one, including the original targeted recipients and the Solana ecosystem.</p><p>As such, along with the BONK early contributors, we would like to propose a plan to help the original recipients claim the tokens in a way that would have the least impact in the market and give the BONK ecosystem to further build up liquidity and trust in the market. </p><p>It is important to note that Jupiter is not a current custodian for the tokens and has nothing to gain from this plan - we are here both to help the targeted recipients get their $BONK and also the project to maintain the great energy and momentum.</p><p>While it is of course not ideal that the tokens were uncovered so late in the launch cycle, we believe that if we put on a united front, this will end up being a net positive for all the key stakeholders - including the targeted recipients, BONK community, n the Solana ecosystem.</p><p>This post will outline the timeline of events, the full technical details of what happened, and an assessment of the current market and proposed plan.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="timeline-of-events">Timeline Of Events<a href="#timeline-of-events" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Timeline Of Events" title="Direct link to Timeline Of Events">​</a></h2><ul><li>Dec 25th 2022 - BONK <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/5Sj8hu81wLSt2RuEUZYNzyuNeoQoGfiKG6BBWwiNdBUYHzU1eGpTg2FUyTUsXAG7BteMLM1hGAtYxShvxqrpQH63" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Airdrop</a> to OpenBook Open Order Accounts</li><li>Jan 6th - Jupiter discovers  $BONK tokens sent to Jupiter-managed OO accounts.

Using a PDA allows the Jupiter program to sign for the address without needing a private key which allows the program to manage these accounts so users don't have to, greatly simplifying the user experience while not having any security or custody implications.</li><li>When $BONK was airdropped to these Jupiter open orders account, it created an Associated Token Account <em>(ATA)</em> for these Jupiter PDAs to store the token.</li><li>In order to access the $BONK held in these ATAs, we will need to update the Jupiter program to allow the tokens to be claimed as only the program can manage these accounts. The latest Jupiter program <em>(V4)</em> has an update authority held by us.</li><li>We maintain update authority on our latest programs in order to regularly add new DEX integrations, fix issues, and work on new features. This also allows us to correct the 10T airdrop and deliver it to the intended recipients.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="market-assessment-and-proposed-plan">Market Assessment and Proposed Plan<a href="#market-assessment-and-proposed-plan" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Market Assessment and Proposed Plan" title="Direct link to Market Assessment and Proposed Plan">​</a></h2><p>As mentioned, given the large amount of tokens at stake and the early stage of the market/ecosystem - a plan to distribute all the tokens at once could have the effect of creating a major crash even before the tokens are retrieved and released - benefitting no one and potentially stopping the nascent BONK project. As such, along with the BONK early contributors, we would like to propose a plan to redistribute to the intended recipients of the original airdrop that mitigates potential market fears while giving the BONK community time to build further confidence in the token and the project. </p><p><strong>The plan is as follows:</strong></p><ol><li>We will work on retrieving the tokens sent to the OpenBook open order accounts</li><li>Set up monthly releases over 12 months because a staggered release will release tokens in a manner that is absorbable by the market, and we believe that the community and ecosystem will continue to mature in the meantime</li><li>The first release will be performed next week to give us enough time to set everything up and for the market and community to digest the news</li><li>Additional incentives will also be provided for these recipients, as long as they continue doing a minimum number of trades that route through OpenBook.</li></ol><p>Besides <em>(3)</em> which will also help to spur ongoing usage of OpenBook, the BONK contributors will also be aiming to assist software development of the project, which aligns with the original intent of sparking OpenBook development.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="next-steps">Next Steps<a href="#next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Next Steps" title="Direct link to Next Steps">​</a></h2><p>We would like to get feedback on this plan from both the targeted recipients and the BONK community. We have opened up a dedicated channel called #bonk in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/jup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our discord</a>, so feel free to chime in there!</p><p>After the plan is finalized, we will proceed to retrieve the tokens on behalf of the users and set up a site to allow recipients to claim tokens as they are released monthly.</p><p>Of course, it would have been ideal if all tokens would've been received simultaneously, but it is now a chance for us as a community to come together and come out stronger from this.  After the many blows suffered by the crypto community (in particular Solana), $BONK has brought much excitement to the market, and we appreciate the chance to play our part in helping this along.</p><p>We would love to see everyone involved in this to work together to keep the great energy going, and create a long term sustained effort towards creating more great tokens and communities for the Solana ecosystem, helping it get to new heights too!</p>]]></content>

Despite of the macro headwinds, we are making awesome progress towards being the swap layer of Solana and helping <strong>move crypto users away from ever having to need to use centralized exchanges like FTX ever again</strong>. </p><p>We also had a really fun community call on <strong>Tuesday 27/12/22</strong>,  and here's a quick summary:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="solana-and-multi-chain">Solana and Multi-chain<a href="#solana-and-multi-chain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solana and Multi-chain" title="Direct link to Solana and Multi-chain">​</a></h2><ul><li>A pretty big deal is being made out of the fact that deGods and other projects are expanding outside of Solana. The main thing is, this is not really a big deal since even on Ethereum, even the most loyal and OG projects are multi-chain in all but name</li><li>That said, the timing is rather unfortunate - since the current narrative about Solana is overwhelmingly negative and this adds to the flood of negativity</li><li>From our point of view, we are heavily invested in Solana, and our long term perspective is not affected.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone, here are some updated thoughts on the Solana landscape, Jupiter direction and community alignment based on my observations over the last few weeks since and from discussions from the last community call. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="solana-landscape">Solana Landscape<a href="#solana-landscape" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solana Landscape" title="Direct link to Solana Landscape">​</a></h2><p>A few months ago, we tweeted that Solana is the most likely candidate to be a major trading hub in crypto, and our confidence in that has not changed. That said, it is important to recognize several key issues plaguing Solana right now. </p><ul><li>For DeFi, these include lack of liquidity depth, decreased on-ramp / off-ramp options, shaky oracles and wrapped tokens.</li><li>Many retail investors still feel very burnt by recent events, and continue to be doubtful over the lack of clarity of FTX in Solana.</li><li>In addition, many developers are unhappy about perceived biases towards insiders and celebrities, and there are also others who have focused their efforts in search of opportunities elsewhere.</li></ul><p>That said, we are still strong believers in Solana’s long term prospects, and believe that Solana is the chain most likely to onboard the next generation of mainstream users.  There are many reasons for this, and one of it is the existence of a unique core developer community that is unlikely to be matched anytime soon by other ecosystems <em>(except than ethereum)</em>, as demonstrated by the amazing speed in which the replacement for Serum came about.</p><p>The combination of a very strong core developer community, existing retail userbase, enthusiasm by various industry players <em>(offchain resources, gaming)</em> and a proven, battle hardened technical platform makes it hard for new entrants to catch up.</p><p>On our end, we have been very active in pushing Solana forward. In the last month alone, we integrated 6 new protocols and upgrades in the last month alone. We are also the first to leverage on Solana’s transaction v2 upgrade, encouraging wallets to support this new standard.  </p><p>Moving forward, we will look to help re-invigorate Solana by investing large amounts of effort in helping improve liquidity and price discovery, showcasing new projects to users and embarking on marketing efforts to help new users come onboard Solana.</p><p>In summary, Solana is weakened, but it is a chance for the existing ecosystem and foundation to reset a lot of the cultural flaws and for new entrants to establish a foothold. And we will work hard to help on every step of the way.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jupiter-direction-and-product">Jupiter Direction And Product<a href="#jupiter-direction-and-product" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Jupiter Direction And Product" title="Direct link to Jupiter Direction And Product">​</a></h2><p>The main goal for Jupiter is to <strong>advance the usage of decentralized liquidity and replace the need for anyone to use centralized liquidity platforms like FTX</strong>. We will do so by aggregating, building or integrating key services under a single, super easy to use system.</p><p>In the near term, we will be making big improvements to our existing system by launching full txn v2 support, making a push for composability, and revealing a new routing engine. </p><p>In the long term, we aim to expand the set of DeFi use cases on Solana, starting with limit orders that leverage on the full availability of liquidity on Solana. In addition, we want to scale the <strong>JUP Promise</strong> of <em>best price</em>, <em>best selection</em>, <em>best ux</em> across the entire crypto universe.</p><p>We have very exciting plans in 2023 for these, will be excited to share more soon! In addition, there were a few other topics that was discussed in the last call regarding product:</p><ol><li>We fix a lot of issues for projects that we integrate since we are often the first to spot issues with their onchain program or sdk issues, or get shit from users when things do not work.</li><li>Possible protocol revenue comes from referral bonuses <em>(need to make this an industry standard)</em>, optional fees <em>(tying to token plans)</em>, positive slippage, new services with fees</li><li>Most of Solana users come through Jupiter in one way or another - how can we use that to help new projects and tokens get discovered?
Will be fun to continue this topics in following calls!</li></ol><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="community-building">Community Building<a href="#community-building" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community Building" title="Direct link to Community Building">​</a></h2><p>The hardest thing about community building is that it is very easy to do the simple thing and hype things up but ruin the goal of building a genuine userbase, evangelists and developers who care about the project long term.</p><p>We started the JUP spirit discussion a few months ago, culminating in what I thought was an awesome representation towards what the community should look like - <em>most vocal, most long term, most critical</em>. </p><p>Our community building program therefore needs to be focused on achieving this, vs creating short term hype, instant gratification or convenient promises. The crypto space suffers greatly from an over-emphasis on these 3, and it is imperative that we do not repeat these mistakes as we go about building the best community in crypto. </p><p>The other major topic that we discussed in the call was around the role of the community - the current consensus is that the community can focus on evangelizing and growth, while the team can focus on building great products that the space needs to wean off our dependence on centralized platforms.</p><p>In addition, here are a few other notes, some from the call, and some from the discussion afterward.</p><ul><li>We believe in rewarding community members who actively participate in improving product, evangelizing Jupiter and trying out new untested products.</li><li>Community ownership needs to be focused on sustainable rewards for long term players or driving growth for a new product</li><li>Users, community, developers are all equally important to us, and we need to make sure all 3 groups are taken care of</li></ul><p>Although we are not ready for a fully liquid token yet, we think we can continue these discussions to move the ball forward:</p><ol><li>Brainstorm how we can be helpful for re-invigorating the Solana landscape</li><li>Agree on the key goal of any community programs we embark on, whether it is growth, ownership or long term alignment</li><li>Focus on quality vs quantity moving forward. Existing discord channels shall be archived, and new ones for quality contributions opened up</li><li>Discuss how we can allow the community to take on enhancement and autonomy for growth and evangelism, vs from team-driven marketing efforts</li></ol><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Even though Solana DeFi has taken quite a big hit this past 2 months - we have been shipping faster than ever before, and we are very confident of delivering great products and value for users in Solana and beyond in our quest to <strong>help wean the space off the need to use centralized systems.</strong> </p><p>Lets buidl the <strong>most long term</strong>, <strong>most constructive</strong> and <strong>most vocal community</strong> in crypto, and achieve this goal together.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We spent the last 2 weeks sharing an ethos for Jupiter’s community and debated how we can best rally and recognize what is important to us. You showed up with passion and ideas. And together, we thought really hard as a community about what matters to us. </p><p>The essence of why community is important is captured here: Without a community, we are just a website and code, much like how the body is just flesh and blood. The soul gives us life, and the community brings Jupiter alive.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="the-jup-spirit">The JUP Spirit<a href="#the-jup-spirit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The JUP Spirit" title="Direct link to The JUP Spirit">​</a></h2><p>With that in mind, we are excited to unveil the JUP Spirit! It will be the guiding force behind our community as we work together to bring decentralized liquidity to everyone.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Jup Spirit" src="/assets/images/jupspirit1-ed568b638981aa47216b4c846d810111.jpg" width="1012" height="506" class="img_MG2L"></p><p><strong>Most Vocal, Most Critical, Most Long Term</strong></p><p>Yup. The JUP Spirit may be simple but it covers so much of what we care about. It captures the essence of being there for Jupiter in the most helpful and genuine way. This is also a massive improvement over the first draft, pointing to the importance of community in co-creating a vision with us.</p><p>Just like how the JUP Promise of Best Tokens, Best Price and Best UX helped us to create one of the top products in DeFi, the JUP Spirit of Most Vocal,
Most Critical and Most Long-Term is a rallying cry to create one of the most active and helpful communities around!</p><p><strong>Most Vocal:</strong> A vocal community does what they can to support and spread Jupiter far and wide. After all, what’s the point of building something great if no one knows about it? Yes, go forth and activate all of the viral dark arts you know.</p><p><strong>Most Critical:</strong> It is very difficult to build a leading aggregator and to stay ahead. The community is out there and we need all of your eyes and ears to help us be the very best. We hope you can give us feedback on all kinds of issues, large or small.</p><p><strong>Most Long-Term:</strong> So much of crypto is plagued by short-termisms – in tokenomics, product and more. We don’t like that. We want to build the most sustainable product and organic community that gives a shit regardless of whether the market is up or down, left or right.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="unleashing-the-jup-spirit">Unleashing The Jup Spirit<a href="#unleashing-the-jup-spirit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unleashing The Jup Spirit" title="Direct link to Unleashing The Jup Spirit">​</a></h2><p>Now that we spent a very productive 2 weeks discussing the JUP Spirit, we are focusing the next 2 weeks on working out how we can unleash the JUP Spirit in our community!</p><p>Here’s what you can look forward to:</p><p><strong>1/ Discord Revamp:</strong> To make it easier for you to participate, we will cut back on some channels that are no longer relevant and open some new ones. It’s day 1 again!</p><p><strong>2/ New Experimental Activities:</strong> We will pause our current set of events (quizzes, weekly winners) to make it easier for new community-led activities in line with the JUP Spirit to arise.</p><p><strong>3/ Rework of Roles:</strong> We will begin to rework roles and incentives to recognize and reward our people, starting with folks who are the most JUP Spirited. </p><p><strong>4/ Updated Community Content:</strong> We will refresh some content like FAQs and invite you to help. </p><p>To kick off this new period, a community call will be held <strong>this Friday, 2pm UTC on our discord</strong> to celebrate the very beginnings of our JUP Spirit bonfire!! It will be a chat with friends and not a 1-way speaking street, so we hope you come and participate actively.</p><h1>Buckle up Jupinauts</h1><p>Together, we hope to build a Jupiter that belongs to all of us. This is the start. </p><p>And yes, this is alpha and financial advice. </p><p><strong>Let's UNLEASH the JUP Spirit!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A strong community is at the heart of every good crypto protocol; especially for Jupiter, our community has been cheering us on, guiding development from day one, and filling in the team’s blindspots with talent and passion. </p><p>We wouldn’t have been the same without you.</p><p>Here are some examples of how the community has shaped Jupiter:</p><ul><li>Helped make Jupiter one of the fastest growing Defi platforms ever by sharing their positive experiences on Twitter, Discords, private groups</li><li>Alerted the team to bugs and issues to make the product as good as it can be</li><li>Supported new users in navigating the platform with a lot of patience and empathy</li><li>Made art that we’ve used in our materials and it made Jupiter more lively</li><li>Translated Jupiter into 7 languages and wrote articles for their home communities</li><li>Created and ran AMAs, trivia, and other events in very creative and engaging ways</li><li>Moderating other users’ comments in discord with care and intuition</li></ul><p>Thanks to everyone’s incredible help, we have made tremendous progress in the last 9 months, which includes crossing $22B in volume traded, being the most integrated protocol in Solana by most of the major projects, running Solana’s most consistent podcast, and growing a substantial organic community. </p><p>As we take the next step towards our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TIIziP3WfKcOKbeFfsLyOV3xxUwC-r4QnT32U_LGPyU/edit#slide=id.g143474f8609_0_117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broader goal of bringing decentralized liquidity to everyone</a>, we would like to invite the community to create a new manifesto and incentive system together.  </p><p>The <strong>JUP Promise</strong> of best token selection, best price, and best experience for users and developers helped Jupiter to become one of the best products and top DEXes in Defi. </p><p>The <strong>JUP Spirit</strong> will help Jupiter build one of the most vocal, most long term oriented and most critical communities in crypto. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="drafting-the-jup-spirit-together-">Drafting The JUP Spirit Together 🎨<a href="#drafting-the-jup-spirit-together-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Drafting The JUP Spirit Together 🎨" title="Direct link to Drafting The JUP Spirit Together 🎨">​</a></h2><p>To get things started, here’s a draft of the JUP Spirit, and the ethos we want to engender. It is a draft of how we envision the community coming together:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Be critical yet optimistic about product improvements:</strong> It is very difficult to build a leading aggregator and maintain that lead. We need YOU to join the hustle. Tell us where we can do better, and be critical yet optimistic about improving the product with us.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tell the world about Jupiter:</strong> If a tree fell in the middle of the forest and no one saw it, did it fall? If Jup is the best Defi product in the world, but no one knows about it, is it still the best product in the world? We need a community committed to pushing us to be the best in the world, and telling the world about it!</p></li><li><p><strong>Maintain a long-term mindset:</strong> Short-termisms plague crypto. We are determined to build a community that is critical yet supportive through ups and downs, lefts and rights, #BUIDL-ing together for the long term. </p></li></ul><p><strong>How to help:</strong> What impressed you so far about the Jupiter community? What other communities do you think have great ethos that moves the project forward? How would you change the draft we have above?</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="how-do-we-manifest-the-jup-spirit">How do we manifest the JUP Spirit?<a href="#how-do-we-manifest-the-jup-spirit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do we manifest the JUP Spirit?" title="Direct link to How do we manifest the JUP Spirit?">​</a></h2><p>On one side is the community ethos; on the other side are the incentives that drive behaviour. We want to create a fun yet meaningful role and incentive system to reward and encourage contributors.  </p><p>Currently, we award roles for Jupion (helpful contributors, winners of events), Jupassador (consistent help and repeated wins), and Jupioneer (the earliest users and contributors to Jupiter when we started and heroic contributors), while XP is awarded for participants of our events such as AMAs and Twitter spaces.</p><p>While our current system has worked very well in terms of bootstrapping the community, there are some issues we need to resolve:</p><ul><li>Impactful contributions (helping us work through bugs, product feedback that gets incorporated, partnership wins, great tweets) are not rewarded</li><li>XP is disjointed from roles and it’s not clear what purpose it serves</li><li>Consistency in community contribution (support, artwork) is not recognised</li></ul><p>We would like to evolve a new system alongside the JUP Spirit that will help us manifest a great community. <strong>This system will also be the foundational groundwork before any decentralised token community is formed.</strong> Not to worry, any existing roles and XP collected to date will be recorded and migrated to the new setup.</p><p>There are many areas that we will like to grow contributions in - developer innovation, art and memes, infographics, active product testers, creative and active evangelism, etc. </p><p>The community sees things that we do not see – they are in many other communities, try the product from a user’s perspective, and leverage Jupiter in ways we can only imagine. We want to tap on the fullness of their talents, skills, and intuition to help Jupiter to grow, by sharing more context and empowering people to act. </p><p><strong>How to help:</strong>  Reading the draft of the JUP Spirit, what do you think is good and what is lacking in terms of our current setup? How do we encourage either valuable or long-term participation?</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="lfgggg">LFGGGG!<a href="#lfgggg" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to LFGGGG!" title="Direct link to LFGGGG!">​</a></h2><p>We will be running this conversation for the next 2 weeks — we hope to come away with renewed energy and a better sense of how to be helpful as a community and embody the JUP Spirit.  This conversation will be facilitated by our 2 newly minted lead mods - Timoon and LJQ, who will be sharing regular updates to keep the conversation going. </p><p>Please refer to the earlier questions in the “How to help” sections and share your thoughts, or just share anything you want! You are probably less boomer and more in touch than us, so you know best.</p><p>Here are the channels to participate in the Jup Spirit discussions. Feel free to cross-post!</p><ul><li><strong>Discord:</strong> The easiest way to chat. Go to 🔆・jup-spirit category in our discord and join the conversation: discord.gg/jup</li><li><strong>Email:</strong> If you’re feeling shy and like it classic, you can email <a href="mailto:feedback@jup.ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feedback@jup.ag</a></li></ul><p>Top contributors will get first dibs on whatever roles are decided in the new system, as well as some awesome amazing Jupiter swag!</p><p>We need to build a strong community foundation ahead of any token-related work. The formation of the JUP Spirit is a crucial step for that foundation that will anchor our main goal of bringing decentralized liquidity to everyone.
Very, very, excited to work together to create the most active, robust and long-term communities in crypto together. </p><p>LFGGGGG!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few months, Jupiter has become the key swap liquidity infrastructure for Solana growing to over $16B in trading volume, aggregating across 15 integrated DEXs and facilitating the liquidity flow of many key projects in the ecosystem.</p><p>What we've accomplished today has been the result of a successful collaboration between the team, the community, and the Solana ecosystem. Only through constant feedback and close collaboration with everyone, have we been able to continually work towards the JUP promise of providing the <em>best price</em>, <em>best token selection</em>, and <em>best UX</em> in DeFi.</p><p>As crypto captures more markets like banking, gaming, and payments, we believe Solana will be one of the key hubs for all that activity, with the number of applications, users, and protocols set to explode in the years to come.  </p><p>Jupiter will provide the single liquidity endpoint for all these stakeholders to connect effortlessly and the swap infra to allow the entire ecosystem to scale exponentially. But, unlocking this growth requires the collective efforts of not just the team, but, a larger body of the community, ecosystem, and users working together.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="why-solana">Why Solana?<a href="#why-solana" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Solana?" title="Direct link to Why Solana?">​</a></h2><p>We are committed to building the swap infrastructure for Solana because we see Solana as becoming one of the key trading hubs of crypto. It is also perfectly positioned to capture the next billion crypto users where usability, transaction costs, and scalability remain key barriers to entry for them.  </p><p>Solana’s blazing speed and throughput are key enablers of innovation. Liquidity protocols that would be impossible on slower and less scalable blockchains, including full-fledged order book systems and rapidly updating oracle-based AMMs, can finally be brought to life on Solana.</p><p>Beyond that, Solana's developer ecosystem is unique in crypto. Rooted by the goal to be the "useful" blockchain in people's daily lives, the ecosystem is filled with some of the smartest, most helpful product-focused builders around building ever more unique, useful and innovative apps.</p><p>Additionally, Solana has also attracted major audiences in finance, gaming, NFT, and payments, enough to reach a tipping point of users, devs, and businesses building on top of it, as seen by the significant growth of dev users and wallet downloads. This will lead to the flywheel effect where more users → more assets → more liquidity in the whole Solana ecosystem, making swap infrastructure more critical for growth.</p><p>As with any trading hub, one critical aspect is the links to external platforms. With Solana, it’s well-poised on both centralized exchanges and decentralized cross-chain connections, and continues to be one of the top priorities for connections with all the emerging protocols and standards. </p><p>Last but not least, the Solana ecosystem is just plain fun. We have been in many crypto ecosystems in the past, and the Solana ecosystem strikes us as the most fun, pragmatic and focused on user experience vs ideologies. And that’s really important for us!</p><p>Of course, there are some critical technical issues to be addressed such as network slowdowns, txn size, and compute unit limits, but we are confident the problems will be resolved by the excellent team over at Solana labs, who have proven time and time again that they are one of the best technical and operational executing blockchains in crypto. </p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="jupiter-overview">Jupiter Overview<a href="#jupiter-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Jupiter Overview" title="Direct link to Jupiter Overview">​</a></h2><p>Originally, Jupiter was a team experiment, where we built a standalone program to integrate Mercurial and Serum to provide more utility for stables like $UST &amp; $PAI and help establish them as key stables in Solana. In doing so, we launched the first cross-protocol liquidity swap on Solana. </p><p>Encouraged by our own dogfooding and the highly receptive response from the community (and the geeks in us loved playing with all the various networks, and solving all the tricky problems, like txn size limits, and all that good stuff), we decided to start Jupiter as a standalone project, launching in November 2021.</p><p>Along the way, we developed the JUP Promise to anchor us to the value we want to deliver - best price, best token selection, and best UX for users and developers. Sticking to this promise, along with the relentless feedback and debugging help provided by our community of users and developers, has been crucial in helping us improve the platform and make significant progress on key objectives.</p><p>We'd like to take the chance to share what these objectives are, the main challenges we had to solve to get here, and some of the cool things we have in the works. :D</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="1-build-the-best-swap-experience-in-defi">1: Build the best swap experience in DeFi<a href="#1-build-the-best-swap-experience-in-defi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1: Build the best swap experience in DeFi" title="Direct link to 1: Build the best swap experience in DeFi">​</a></h3><p>With everyone's help, we've come a long way towards building one of the best aggregators in DeFi, with the goal of allowing anyone using Solana for the first time to have an amazing experience trading with the best price and best experience possible. </p><p>To have the most comprehensive liquidity coverage in Solana along with a seamless experience, there were a large number of technical challenges we had to solve, including fitting advanced swap routes within the transaction size limit of 1232 bytes and compute unit limits, and incorporating very different technical models like Serum’s orderbook mechanism, Lifinity’s rapidly updating oracle based pricing mechanism and Crema’s concentrated liquidity mechanism.</p><p>Over time, we have developed a very strong and flexible technical foundation (both on-chain and off-chain), as well as a solid process of working closely with other teams to overcome any initial technical challenges, sharing feedback and often working with them very early in their launch process to improve their platform and SDK, allowing us to roll out new integrations rapidly. </p><p>Now, we have the widest and most comprehensive liquidity coverage in Solana, having integrated over 15 DEXes into one seamless interface and SDK, including very technically different platforms like Serum, Orca, Lifinity, and Crema.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="2-be-the-swap-infrastructure-for-solana">2: Be the swap infrastructure for Solana<a href="#2-be-the-swap-infrastructure-for-solana" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2: Be the swap infrastructure for Solana" title="Direct link to 2: Be the swap infrastructure for Solana">​</a></h3><p>To ensure the seamless and healthy flow of liquidity throughout the ecosystem, we work towards providing the most comprehensive and robust swap infrastructure possible for Solana for any user or project to reliably transact on. </p><p>We do so by providing a single liquidity endpoint where any users, dapp and protocol can seamlessly access all the available liquidity, achieving the best price and ux for their own projects, regardless of whatever platform or language they are using. This liquidity endpoint is accessible via 3 main mechanisms: A user facing website on jup.ag, a comprehensive and robust SDK and API, and onchain program instructions.</p><p>We have since built up an extremely diverse ecosystem of projects leveraging Jupiter for their swap needs, including top Solana projects like Mango, Tulip, Defi Land - ranging from native swaps in wallets to facilitating key DeFi use cases like vaults, liquidations, and payments.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="3-build-one-of-the-best-communities-in-crypto">3: Build one of the best communities in crypto<a href="#3-build-one-of-the-best-communities-in-crypto" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3: Build one of the best communities in crypto" title="Direct link to 3: Build one of the best communities in crypto">​</a></h3><p>With over 50k community members across Twitter and Discord, we have built one of the best organic DeFi communities in Solana. Our community has been a cornerstone of Jupiter’s development and growth. This is true not just for product, but also in terms of evangelising, support, content contributions, and just plain vibe, making Jupiter a fun place to spend time connecting with others.</p><p>What makes our community so special is an amazing group of content creators and moderators who have created a lot of great content, spread a lot of great energy, answered questions, and also led a lot of events, including community AMAs, where we discuss various community members journey into crypto, international AMAs, etc.</p><p>Beyond that, our community has been essential at evangelising Jupiter to the other users and the ecosystem, with many of the most important integrations and partnerships have come because various members have spoken up and championed Jupiter in their respective communities, with Mango, DeFi Land, and Project Galaxy are just a few notable examples.</p><p>Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) has been a constant initiative for us to connect with key players in the ecosystem and vice versa, which eventually blossomed into some amazing partnerships. Not only that, it’s a really helpful platform for all of our community to learn more about DeFi protocols, NFTs, GameFi projects, and the Solana ecosystem in-depth. In the AMA series, we hosted some of the most talented guest speakers in Solana and garnered a wide range of audiences live on Twitter Spaces and Discord. </p><p>The series then continued on to morph into our very own podcast series - Exploring Solana with Jupiter - to reach a larger audience especially outside of Solana, for people to learn more about the community.</p><p>Our growing community of developers building on top of Jupiter have helped us be able to scale supporting the growing number of projects who all have different platforms and use cases they are building for. They’ve not only shared solutions that have worked but also code.</p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_CuU3" id="whats-next">What's next?<a href="#whats-next" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's next?" title="Direct link to What's next?">​</a></h2><p>Despite the incredible progress we have made the past 6 months, the whole ecosystem is only at its infancy and there is still so much more work to do in order to help Solana scale. It is also because we are at this early stage, there is so much potential and opportunities waiting to be unleashed.</p><p>Jupiter will be kickstarting a new phase and we are planning on many exciting developments. On the product side, we are going to support interesting integrations like direct staking/ minting routes and a wider range of use cases such as Solana Pay, TWAP and streaming payments. As more liquidity sources and tokens come online, enabling routing between all of them and maintaining a scalable robust swap layer will be an ongoing investment in infrastructure building.</p><p>On the community end, we hope to nurture the next set of leaders who can eventually lead our teams, truly embodying the spirit of empowerment and service of the community. We have also seen much success with our AMAs series and we will increase our content marketing such as podcasts and opinion pieces, to educate and bring new users to Solana.</p><p>As we look beyond Solana, we see many opportunities to improve cross-chain migration of assets into and out of Solana with Jupiter well placed to add immense value in this area.</p>]]></content>
